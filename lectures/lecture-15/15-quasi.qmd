## When experiments are not possible

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The [experimental ideal]{.alert} is not always feasible
  - [Ethical constraints]{.alert}, [logistical challenges]{.alert}, [political barriers]{.alert}
- [Natural experiments]{.alert}: When "nature" (broadly speaking) does the randomisation
  - [Examples]{.alert}: Earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics, lottery wins
- [Quasi-experiments]{.alert}: Broader term than natural experiments, sometimes we can control the treatment but not the assignment
  - [Examples]{.alert}: School vouchers, minimum wage laws, health interventions, policy changes
  - [Methods to estimate causal effects]{.alert}: Difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables
- They are [somewhere between observational and experimental studies]{.alert}, and have received increased attention in recent decades

# The experimental ideal and its limits 🌟 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Why we should think about observational studies with RCTs in mind

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- As you already know by now, RCTs have the highest internal validity among all research designs
- Since the treatment is isolated from other factors, we can be more confident about the causal effect
- But RCTs are not always feasible, and sometimes they are not ethical or practical
  - [Example]{.alert}: Testing the effects of smoking on health outcomes, or of poverty on child development
- In these cases, we need to think creatively about how to estimate causal effects
- Yet, [the logic of RCTs should guide our thinking]{.alert} in observational studies
  - [Random assignment]{.alert}, [control groups]{.alert}, [pre-treatment equivalence]{.alert}, [selection bias]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Natural and quasi-experiments]{.alert} are attempts to [approximate the conditions of an RCT when true randomisation is not possible]{.alert}
- They are ["second-best" in terms of internal validity]{.alert} compared to a well-executed RCT
- But they are often the best available or only feasible options
- [Both RCTs and natural/quasi-experiments are driven by the same goal]{.alert}: to establish causal relationships
- The core logic of experiments, that is, [of counterfactuals and potential outcomes]{.alert}, is the same
- Natural and quasi-experiments often have [higher external validity]{.alert} than RCTs, as they are closer to real-world conditions
- But we only use [observational data]{.alert}

# Natural experiments 🌍 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Definition

:::{style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- [Natural experiments]{.alert} are situations where the assignment of treatment is determined by nature or other factors outside the control of the researcher
- They are [quasi-experimental]{.alert} designs that mimic the random assignment of treatments in experimental studies
- In many ways, they are the "[gold standard]{.alert}" (so to speak!) for causal inference in observational studies
- There are mainly [two kinds of natural experiments]{.alert}:
  - [True natural experiments]{.alert}: When the treatment is [indeed randomly assigned]{.alert}
  - [As-if natural experiments]{.alert}: When the treatment is [assigned by a procedure]{.alert} that we claim is as good as random for practical purposes
  - [Examples of true natural experiments]{.alert}: Natural disasters, weather changes, lottery wins
  - [Examples of as-if natural experiments]{.alert}: Eligibility rules, policy changes, roll-out of new technologies
:::

## True natural experiments

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- [True natural experiments]{.alert} are rare but great opportunities for causal inference
- They can be analysed in [the same way as RCTs]{.alert}, with [treatment and control groups]{.alert} and [pre-treatment equivalence]{.alert}
- The same concerns about [internal validity]{.alert} apply to true natural experiments
  - [Attrition]{.alert}
  - [Non-compliance]{.alert} 
  - [Contamination]{.alert}
- However, the researcher needs to make [stronger assumptions]{.alert} about the assignment mechanism in true natural experiments 
- Yet often it is indeed the case that the assignment is random

## Research question and challenge

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Research question]{.alert}: What is the *causal effect* of attending charter schools in Massachusetts on student test scores?
- [The challenge]{.alert}: Students who choose to attend charter schools are likely to be different from those who don't
    -  Maybe more motivated families, different prior academic preparation, etc.
    -  This is [selection bias!]{.alert}
-  We need a way to isolate the causal effect of charter schools, not just correlation
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [The clever idea]{.alert}:  Many charter schools are oversubscribed and use lotteries to decide who gets in
- [Instrumental Variable (IV) Approach]{.alert}:  Use a lottery win as an instrument to estimate the causal effect of charter attendance.
-  Lottery win $\rightarrow$ Charter Attendance $\rightarrow$ Test Scores
-  Lottery win is related to charter attendance, but ideally *only* affects test scores through charter attendance.
:::
:::

## Estimation strategy

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Equation (1)]{.alert}: Outcome equation (What we want to explain)

$Y_{igt} = \alpha_{2t} + \beta_{2g} + \sum_{j} \delta_{j} d_{ij} + X_{i}' \theta + \tau S_{igt} + \epsilon_{igt}$

-  $Y_{igt}$: Test score for student *i*, grade *g*, year *t*
-  $S_{igt}$: Years spent in charter school (our treatment)
-  $\tau$:  [Causal effect of charter attendance]{.alert} (what we want to find!)
-  Lots of control variables (year ($\alpha_{2t}$) and grade ($\beta_{2g}$) fixed effects, dummies for combinations of charter school lotteries ($d_{ij}$), demographic characteristics ($X_i$), etc.) to account for other factors
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Equation (2)]{.alert}: First Stage (How the lottery affects attendance)

$S_{igt} = \alpha_{1t} + \beta_{1g} + \sum_{j} \kappa_{ij} d_{ij} + X_{i}' \mu + \pi Z_{i} + \eta_{igt}$

-  $Z_i$:  Dummy variable = 1 if student *i* won the charter lottery (our instrument)
-  $\pi$:  Effect of lottery win on charter attendance (should be positive and strong)

- [In Plain English]{.alert}:

1. **First Stage:** Check if winning the lottery actually increases charter school attendance (it should!)
2. **Second Stage:** Use the *lottery win* (which is random) to predict charter school attendance, and then see how this *predicted* attendance affects test scores

##  "As-If" randomness: The core assumption of natural experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- The validity of most natural/quasi-experiments hinges on the assumption of ["as-if" randomness]{.alert}
- We need to argue for the [plausibility that the natural assignment mechanism is exogenous]{.alert}
    - Independent of other factors that influence the outcome
- Consider:
    - Is the "natural" assignment process truly [independent of confounding variables]{.alert}?
    - Could individuals or groups have [influenced the "assignment"]{.alert} to treatment or control?
    - Is there evidence of [pre-existing differences]{.alert} between the groups "naturally" assigned to different conditions?
- Requires careful [justification and scrutiny]{.alert} of the assignment process
- Not always perfect randomness, but [sufficient approximation for causal inference]{.alert} in many cases

# Quasi-experiments 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Quasi-experiments: A broader toolkit for approximation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Quasi-experiments encompass a [wider range of designs]{.alert} that lack full random assignment by the researcher
- Often involve some researcher manipulation of the research design, but not direct treatment randomisation
- Includes natural experiments as a subset, but also encompasses designs where researchers [actively construct comparison groups]{.alert}
- Key feature: [strategic use of design and statistical techniques]{.alert} to address confounding and selection bias
- Examples of Quasi-Experimental Designs (we also use them to analyse natural experiments!):
    - [Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)]{.alert}
    - [Difference-in-Differences (DID)]{.alert}
    - [Instrumental Variables (IV)]{.alert}
    - [Matching Methods]{.alert}
:::

## Regression discontinuity design (RDD)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- RDD exploits sharp or fuzzy discontinuities in treatment assignment based on a [threshold or cutoff score]{.alert}
- Units are assigned to treatment or control based on whether they fall above or below a specific cutoff point on a [continuous assignment variable (running variable)]{.alert}
- Compares units [just above the threshold to units just below]{.alert}
  - For the linear case, $Y = \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X + \beta_{2}(X > X_{0}) + \epsilon$
- Logic: Units very close to the cutoff are likely to be [very similar in all other respects]{.alert}, except for treatment status
- Cutoff creates a [local "as-if" randomisation]{.alert} around the threshold
- RDD estimates the [treatment effect at the discontinuity point]{.alert}
- Key Assumption: [Continuity]{.alert}
    - Potential outcomes are continuous functions of the assignment variable at the cutoff
    - No other discontinuous changes at the cutoff point besides the treatment

- Treatment assigned for [D >= Cutoff]{.alert}
- [Continuity assumption]{.alert}: Smooth relationship between X and Y, except for the treatment effect at the cutoff
- [Fuzzy RDD]{.alert}: When treatment assignment is not perfectly determined by the cutoff (some non-compliance)
- [Manipulation]{.alert} of assignment variable can invalidate RDD
- [Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)]{.alert}: RDD estimates the effect for those near the cutoff
- Extrapolation beyond the cutoff is [generally not recommended]{.alert}

## Difference-in-Differences (DID): Leveraging policy changes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Core Idea: Compare changes in outcomes [over time between a treatment group and a control group]{.alert}
- Exploits naturally occurring events or policy changes that affect one group but not another
- Relies on comparing the [difference in changes]{.alert} (hence "difference-in-differences")
    - Change in outcome for treatment group - Change in outcome for control group
- Aims to isolate the treatment effect from:
    - [Pre-existing differences]{.alert} between groups (captured by baseline differences)
    - [Common trends over time]{.alert} (assumed to affect both groups similarly)
- Key Assumption: [Parallel Trends]{.alert}
    - In the absence of treatment, the treatment and control groups would have followed similar trends in outcomes

    - $T_{i}$: Treatment indicator (1 if treated, 0 otherwise)
    - $D_{t}$: Time indicator (1 if post-treatment, 0 otherwise)

# Threats to validity and mitigation strategies {background-color="#2d4563"}

##  Major threats to validity in quasi-experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [Confounding (selection bias):]{.alert}
    - Pre-existing differences between treatment and control groups that are related to both treatment and outcome
    - Can bias estimates in any quasi-experimental design
- [Violation of key assumptions:]{.alert}
    - Parallel trends assumption in DID may not hold
    - Continuity assumption in RDD may be violated
    - Instrument validity assumptions (relevance and exclusion) in IV may be questionable
    - Selection on observables assumption in Matching may be false
- [Measurement error:]{.alert} Can attenuate or bias estimates in any design
- [Spillover effects/interference:]{.alert} Treatment effects in one group can affect outcomes in the control group, violating stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA)
- [Attrition and missing data:]{.alert} Differential attrition between treatment and control groups can introduce bias
:::

## Strategies for strengthening validity

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- [Careful design choice:]{.alert} Select the most appropriate quasi-experimental design given the research question and context
- [Robustness checks and sensitivity analyses:]{.alert}
    - Test the sensitivity of findings to violations of key assumptions
    - Conduct placebo tests, falsification tests, and alternative specifications
- [Control variables:]{.alert} Include relevant covariates to control for observable confounding
- [Assumption checks and justification:]{.alert}
    - Clearly state and justify the assumptions of the chosen design
    - Provide evidence to support the plausibility of assumptions (e.g., pre-treatment trends for DID, density tests for RDD, instrument relevance tests for IV)
- [Triangulation:]{.alert} Use multiple methods and data sources to corroborate findings
- [Transparency:]{.alert} Be transparent about design limitations and assumptions in reporting results
:::

## Ethics beyond randomisation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- While quasi-experiments often arise from ethical constraints on randomisation, ethical considerations remain important
- Be transparent about the [limitations of the design and assumptions]{.alert} being made
- Quasi-experimental findings may be [more easily misinterpreted]{.alert} than RCT results - emphasize responsible communication
- Consequences: Consider potential [unintended consequences]{.alert} of studying natural events or policy changes, especially if findings inform future interventions
- Maintain ethical standards in data collection, storage, and analysis, especially when using sensitive data
- Even in observational settings, consider ethical guidelines for data collection and participant interaction
- Ethical review boards may still be involved in quasi-experimental research, especially if it involves human subjects data

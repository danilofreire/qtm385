# What is Mediation? ðŸ¤” {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The Causal Chain: Z â†’ M â†’ Y

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Experiments often tell us *that* a treatment ($Z$) affects an outcome ($Y$).
- [Mediation analysis]{.alert} asks *how* or *why* this effect occurs.
- It investigates the role of [intermediate variables (mediators, $M$)]{.alert} that lie on the causal path between $Z$ and $Y$.
- The core idea: [$Z$ causes $M$, and $M$ causes $Y$]{.alert}.
- Examples:
  - Limes ($Z$) â†’ Vitamin C intake ($M$) â†’ Reduced scurvy ($Y$)
  - Reserving council seats for women ($Z$) â†’ Female incumbency/Changed attitudes ($M$) â†’ Election of women later ($Y$) (Bhavnani 2009)
- Goal: [Identify the pathways]{.alert} through which $Z$ transmits its influence to $Y$

## Why Care About Mechanisms?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Scientific Understanding]{.alert}: Moves beyond "black box" descriptions to explanatory theories. How does the world work?
- [Refining Theory]{.alert}: Tests specific theoretical propositions about causal processes
- [Designing Better Interventions]{.alert}: If we know *why* something works, we might find more efficient or potent ways to achieve the same outcome (e.g., Vitamin C tablets instead of limes)
  - [Mediators themselves can have mediators!]{.alert}
- [Generalisability]{.alert}: Understanding the mechanism helps predict if an effect will hold in different contexts where the mediator might operate differently
- Audiences and policymakers almost always ask about mechanisms!

# The Traditional Approach: Regression ðŸ“ˆ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The Three-Equation System

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- A very common approach to estimate mediation is to use a three-equation system:
  1.  Regress the mediator ($M$) on the treatment ($Z$):
      $M_i = \alpha_1 + a Z_i + e_{1i}$ [Effect of Z on M: $\hat{a}$]{.alert}
  2.  Regress the outcome ($Y$) on the treatment ($Z$):
      $Y_i = \alpha_2 + c Z_i + e_{2i}$ [Total effect of Z on Y: $\hat{c}$]{.alert}
  3.  Regress the outcome ($Y$) on both the treatment ($Z$) and the mediator ($M$):
      $Y_i = \alpha_3 + d Z_i + b M_i + e_{3i}$ [Effect of M on Y: $\hat{b}$; Direct effect of Z on Y: $\hat{d}$]{.alert}
- $Z$ is randomly assigned (uncorrelated with errors, unbiased estimates of $Z$ in equations 01 and 02), but $M$ [is *not*]{.alert} (equation 03). $M$ is an outcome of $Z$. [So it is an observational study!]{.alert}
:::

## Decomposing Effects (Under Strong Assumptions)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- If we assume [constant treatment effects]{.alert} (a, b, c, d are the same for everyone) and certain other conditions hold...
- The total effect (c) can be decomposed:
  - [Total Effect (c)]{.alert}: How much $Y$ changes for a one-unit change in $Z$. Estimated from Eq. (2).
  - [Direct Effect (d)]{.alert}: How much $Y$ changes for a one-unit change in $Z$, *holding $M$ constant*. Estimated from Eq. (3).
  - [Indirect Effect (ab)]{.alert}: How much of $Z$'s effect on $Y$ is transmitted *through* $M$. Calculated as $\hat{a} \times \hat{b}$ (or $\hat{c} - \hat{d}$).
- This decomposition ($c = d + ab$) is the cornerstone of traditional mediation analysis.
- **BUT:** This [relies heavily on the constant effects assumption.]{.alert}

## The Constant Effects Assumption Revisited

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- Remember from heterogeneous effects: [causal effects often vary!]{.alert}
- If $a_i$ and $b_i$ vary across individuals, then the average indirect effect is $E[a_i b_i]$
- $E[a_i b_i] = E[a_i] E[b_i] + Cov(a_i, b_i)$
- Simply multiplying the average effect of $Z$ on $M$ ($\hat{a} \approx E[a_i]$) by the average effect of $M$ on $Y$ ($\hat{b} \approx E[b_i]$) only gives the average indirect effect if $[Cov(a_i, b_i) = 0]$.
- This covariance term is generally [not zero and not identifiable]{.alert}.
- So, the simple $c = d + ab$ decomposition breaks down with heterogeneous effects.
:::

## The Problem with Equation (3): Endogeneity of $M$

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- Even if we ignore heterogeneous effects for a moment... Equation (3) is problematic: $Y_i = \alpha_3 + d Z_i + b M_i + e_{3i}$
- $Z$ is random, but [$M$ is an outcome variable]{.alert}. It's very likely correlated with the error term $e_{3i}$.
- Why? [Unobserved confounders]{.alert} might affect both M and Y.
- **Example (Bhavnani):** Unmeasured local 'egalitarianism' ($e_{3i}$) might encourage women to run for office ($M$) *and* make voters more likely to elect women ($Y$), independently of the reservation policy ($Z$).
- Including $M$ in the regression is [like including a post-treatment variable]{.alert} that is correlated with the error term!
:::

## Regression Approach Summary

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- Relies on [strong, often implausible assumptions]{.alert}:
  - Constant treatment effects (for $c = d + ab$)
  - No unobserved confounding between $M$ and $Y$ (for unbiased $\hat{b}$ and $\hat{d}$)
- These assumptions are [not guaranteed by random assignment of $Z$]{.alert} alone.
- Prone to bias that exaggerates the mediator's role and downplays the treatment's direct effect.
- [Use with extreme caution, if at all]{.alert}, for causal mediation claims based solely on $Z$ randomisation.

# A Potential Outcomes View {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Defining Potential Outcomes for Mediation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- Let's apply our familiar framework. For each individual $i$:
  - $Z_i$: Randomly assigned treatment (0 or 1)
  - $M_i(z)$: Potential value of the mediator if assigned to treatment $z$
  - $Y_i(z)$: Potential value of the outcome if assigned to treatment $z$
- Observed variables:
  - $M_i = M_i(Z_i)$
  - $Y_i = Y_i(Z_i)$
- Average Treatment Effect (Total Effect): $ATE = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$
- Effect of $Z$ on $M$: $E[M_i(1) - M_i(0)]$
- These are estimable from a standard experiment randomising $Z$.
:::

## Expanding Potential Outcomes: $Y_i(m, z)$

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- To formally define direct and indirect effects, [we need a more complex notation]{.alert} (Imai, Keele, Yamamoto 2010; Robins & Greenland 1992):
- $Y_i(m, z)$: Potential outcome for individual $i$ if their mediator were set to value $m$ AND they were assigned treatment $z$.
- This allows us to think about hypothetical scenarios:
  - What would $Y$ be if we gave the treatment ($z=1$) but somehow forced the mediator to the level it would have taken under control ($m=M_i(0)$)? This would be $Y_i(M_i(0), 1)$.
  - These are [complex potential outcomes]{.alert} because they involve situations that can never happen in reality (more on that soon!).
- Linking back: $Y_i(1) = Y_i(M_i(1), 1)$ and $Y_i(0) = Y_i(M_i(0), 0)$.
:::

## Defining Effects with $Y(m, z)$

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- Using this notation, we can define effects more precisely:
- **Total Effect (ATE):** $E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)] = E[Y_i(M_i(1), 1) - Y_i(M_i(0), 0)]$
- **Controlled Direct Effect (CDE):** Effect of $Z$ on $Y$, holding $M$ fixed at some level $m$.
  - $CDE(m) = E[Y_i(m, 1) - Y_i(m, 0)]$
- **Natural Direct Effect (NDE):** Effect of $Z$ on $Y$ if $M$ were held at the level it *would have taken* under control.
  - $NDE = E[Y_i(M_i(0), 1) - Y_i(M_i(0), 0)]$
- **Natural Indirect Effect (NIE):** Effect of $M$ changing from $M_i(0)$ to $M_i(1)$, holding $Z$ fixed (usually at $Z=1$ for policy relevance).
  - $NIE = E[Y_i(M_i(1), 1) - Y_i(M_i(0), 1)]$
- Under certain assumptions, $ATE = NDE + NIE$.
:::

## The Challenge: Complex Potential Outcomes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- Look closely at the definitions of NDE and NIE:
  - NDE involves $Y_i(M_i(0), 1)$
  - NIE involves $Y_i(M_i(0), 1)$
- [These are "complex" or "counterfactual" potential outcomes]{.alert}.
  - $Y_i(M_i(0), 1)$ represents the outcome under treatment ($Z=1$), but with the mediator at the level it would take under control ($M=M(0)$).
- [This state can never happen in reality!]{.alert} If $Z_i=1$, we observe $M_i(1)$, not $M_i(0)$.
- These potential outcomes are [fundamentally unobservable]{.alert} from any single experiment just randomising $Z$.
- Now you see why [mediation analysis is so tricky and why we don't do it often!]{.alert}
:::

## Fundamental Problem Recap

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- Estimating the theoretically precise Natural Direct Effect (NDE) and Natural Indirect Effect (NIE) requires knowing the values of complex potential outcomes like $Y_i(M_i(0), 1)$.
- Since these are unobservable, [we cannot estimate NDE and NIE without making strong assumptions]{.alert}.
- Common assumptions include versions of "sequential ignorability" (Imai et al.), essentially assuming M is "as-if randomised" conditional on Z and pre-treatment covariates â€“ very similar to the assumption needed for the regression approach to be unbiased.
- Just randomising Z is [not sufficient]{.alert} to identify mediation pathways without these extra assumptions.
:::

# Can We Address This? ðŸ¤” {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Ruling Out Mediators (A Modest Goal)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- What if we can show that $Z$ has *no effect* on $M$?
- If $M_i(1) = M_i(0)$ for *all* individuals $i$ (the [sharp null hypothesis]{.alert}), then $M$ cannot possibly mediate the effect of Z.
- In this case, the complex potential outcomes simplify: $Y_i(M_i(0), 1) = Y_i(M_i(1), 1) = Y_i(1)$. The NIE becomes zero.
- **How to test this?**
  - Estimate the average effect: $E[M_i(1) - M_i(0)]$. If it's precisely zero...
  - Test for heterogeneity: Check if $Var(M_i(1))$ differs from $Var(M_i(0))$. (As discussed in Lecture 18). If variances are similar and ATE is zero, it lends *support* to the sharp null.
- [Ruling out mediators is easier than quantifying mediation]{.alert}. Useful for eliminating hypotheses.
:::

## Manipulating the Mediator Directly?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- What if we design an experiment that randomises *both* $Z$ and $M$? (A factorial design!)
- Example: 2x2 design
  - Group 1: $Z=0$, $M=0$ (Control)
  - Group 2: $Z=0$, $M=1$ (Manipulate $M$ only)
  - Group 3: $Z=1$, $M=0$ (Manipulate $Z$, block $M$?)
  - Group 4: $Z=1$, $M=1$ (Manipulate $Z$ and $M$)
- This helps estimate Controlled Direct Effects (CDEs). E.g., Effect of $Z$ holding $M$ at 0 is (Group 3 - Group 1). Effect of $M$ holding $Z$ at 1 is (Group 4 - Group 3).
- **BUT:** This still [doesn't directly estimate the NDE or NIE]{.alert}, because $M$ is *set* experimentally, not allowed to take its "natural" value $M_i(z)$. But why is this important?
- [Manipulating $M$ might be hard or artificial]{.alert} (e.g., giving Vitamin C tablets vs. limes might have different effects beyond Vitamin C).
:::

## The Encouragement Design Analogy

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Often, we can't directly set $M$. Instead, we use an "encouragement" $Z$ to try and influence $M$.
- Think back to non-compliance and Instrumental Variables (IV):
  - $Z$ = Assignment/Encouragement (e.g., offer tutoring)
  - $M$ = Treatment Received (e.g., actually attend tutoring)
  - $Y$ = Outcome (e.g., test score)
- We can use $Z$ as an instrument for $M$ to estimate the effect of $M$ on $Y$ for Compliers (CACE/LATE).
- [This is sometimes framed as a mediation analysis]{.alert}: $Z$ affects $Y$ *through* its effect on $M$.
- Formula: $CACE_{M \to Y} = \frac{ITT_{Y}}{ITT_{M}} = \frac{E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]}{E[M|Z=1] - E[M|Z=0]}$
:::

## The Excludability Problem for IV/Mediation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- For the IV estimate of the effect of $M$ on $Y$ to be valid, we need the [exclusion restriction]{.alert}.
- In the mediation context, this means [$Z$ must affect $Y$ *only* through $M$]{.alert}. There can be no direct path from $Z$ to $Y$ ($d=0$).
- [This is a very strong assumption!]{.alert} Often, the encouragement ($Z$) might affect the outcome ($Y$) through other channels besides the intended mediator ($M$).
- Example (Bhavnani): Seat reservations ($Z$) might affect future elections ($Y$) not just by creating incumbents ($M1$), but also by changing voter attitudes ($M2$) or mobilising different voters ($M3$).
- If $Z$ has a direct effect or affects multiple mediators, the simple IV approach doesn't isolate the effect through one specific $M$.
- Identifying effects through multiple mediators requires multiple encouragements (instruments) with different effects on the mediators â€“ very complex!
:::

# A Different Approach: Implicit Mediation ðŸ’¡ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Scaling Back Ambitions: Focus on Treatment Components

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Given the challenges of formally estimating direct/indirect effects or using IV with strong assumptions...
- An alternative: [Implicit Mediation Analysis]{.alert}.
- Instead of trying to measure M and model the Z â†’ M â†’ Y pathway explicitly...
- [Focus on the treatment Z itself]{.alert}. Many treatments are "bundles" of different components.
- Design experiments that [add or subtract specific components]{.alert} of the treatment bundle.
- Compare the effects of these different treatment variations.
- This implicitly tests the importance of the components (and the mediators they likely affect) without needing to measure M or make strong assumptions about unobservables.
:::

## Example: Conditional Cash Transfers (CCTs)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- CCT programmes give cash to poor families if they meet certain conditions (e.g., school attendance, health check-ups).
- Potential mediators: Increased income (cash effect), Changed behaviour due to rules (conditionality effect).
- **Implicit Mediation Design:** (e.g., Baird et al. 2009)
  - Group 1: Control (no programme)
  - Group 2: Unconditional Cash Transfer (UCT - gets cash, no rules)
  - Group 3: Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT - gets cash + rules)
- **Comparisons:**
  - (Group 2 - Group 1): Effect of cash alone.
  - (Group 3 - Group 1): Effect of cash + conditions.
  - (Group 3 - Group 2): Effect of conditions (holding cash constant).
- This tells us about the importance of the *conditions* (likely mediator: behaviour change) vs. the *cash* (likely mediator: income) without directly measuring parental behaviour or income changes and modelling them.
:::

## Example: Voter Turnout Postcards (Gerber, Green, Larimer 2008)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Famous experiment testing social pressure effects on voting.
- Treatment "ingredients" gradually added:
  - Group 1: Control (no mail)
  - Group 2: "Civic Duty" mailer (basic encouragement)
  - Group 3: "Hawthorne" mailer (Civic Duty + told they are being studied)
  - Group 4: "Self" mailer (Hawthorne + shown own household's past voting record)
  - Group 5: "Neighbors" mailer (Self + shown neighbours' past voting records)
- Implicit mediators: Sense of duty, being watched, accountability for own record, comparison to neighbours.
:::

## Voter Turnout Results (Table 10.2)

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center; font-size: 25px;"}
**Illustrative Turnout Rates:**

| Group               | Treatment Components                     | Turnout | Effect vs Control |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :-----: | :---------------: |
| 1. Control          | None                                     | 29.7%   |        --         |
| 2. Civic Duty       | Encouragement                            | 31.5%   |     [+1.8%]{.alert}    |
| 3. Hawthorne        | Encouragement + Monitoring             | 32.2%   |     [+2.5%]{.alert}    |
| 4. Self             | Encouragement + Monitoring + Own Record  | 34.5%   |     [+4.8%]{.alert}    |
| 5. Neighbors        | Encouragement + Monitoring + All Records | 37.8%   |     [+8.1%]{.alert}    |

*(Based on Gerber, Green, and Larimer 2008)*

- [Clear pattern: Adding social pressure components significantly increases turnout]{.alert}.
- Comparing Group 5 vs 4 suggests disclosing neighbours' records adds ~3.3% effect.
- Comparing Group 4 vs 3 suggests disclosing own record adds ~2.3% effect.
- Tells us *which ingredients matter* without modelling psychological states.
:::

## Interpreting Implicit Mediation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- This approach identifies [which aspects of a complex intervention drive the effect]{.alert}.
- It suggests the likely importance of different mediating *processes* (e.g., social comparison is powerful for turnout) without needing to directly measure or model the mediator variable (e.g., feelings of shame/pride).
- It's inherently [design-based]{.alert} and stays within the clean framework of comparing randomly assigned groups.
- Very useful for [programme evaluation and refinement]{.alert}. What are the active ingredients?
:::

## Strengths of Implicit Mediation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Avoids bias]{.alert} inherent in regression-based mediation with non-randomised mediators.
- Stays within the [unbiased statistical framework]{.alert} of comparing randomised groups.
- Lends itself to [exploration and discovery]{.alert} of effective treatment variations.
- Relies on [weaker, design-based assumptions]{.alert} rather than statistical assumptions about unobservables.
- Often more [practical and feasible]{.alert} than trying to perfectly manipulate or measure mediators in field settings.

# Conclusion {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Key Takeaways on Mediation

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Mediation analysis seeks to understand *how* a treatment Z affects an outcome Y through an intermediate variable M ([causal mechanisms]{.alert}).
- Traditional [regression approaches are widespread but problematic]{.alert}:
  - Rely on constant effects assumption.
  - Suffer from bias due to unobserved confounding between M and Y.
  - Tend to overestimate M's role and underestimate Z's direct role.
- The [potential outcomes framework reveals fundamental challenges]{.alert}:
  - Estimating natural direct/indirect effects requires observing complex potential outcomes that are inherently unobservable.
  - Randomising Z alone is insufficient; strong assumptions are needed.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- [Experimentally manipulating M]{.alert} helps estimate controlled effects but doesn't fully solve the problem and may be artificial.
- Using Z as an [instrument for M requires the strong exclusion restriction]{.alert} (no direct Z->Y path), often violated.
- [Ruling out mediators]{.alert} (showing Z doesn't affect M) is a more modest but achievable goal.
- [Implicit mediation analysis]{.alert} is a pragmatic, design-based alternative:
  - Varies treatment components experimentally.
  - Compares effects to infer which components (and likely mechanisms) matter.
  - Avoids modelling M directly, relies on fewer assumptions.
:::
:::
:::

## Final Thoughts

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- Be [critical of causal mediation claims]{.alert}, especially those based solely on standard regression methods after randomising only Z.
- Ask about the [assumptions]{.alert} being made (constant effects? no confounding? exclusion restriction?).
- Favour [design-based approaches]{.alert} where possible.
- [Implicit mediation]{.alert} offers a robust way to gain insights into mechanisms by comparing different versions of a treatment.
- Understanding mechanisms is crucial, but requires careful thought about identification strategies!

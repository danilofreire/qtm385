- [PAPs are not perfect]{.alert}: 50% of researchers spend more than 2 weeks writing them
- Common pitfalls:
  - [Over-specification]{.alert} of analysis paths
  - [Underpowered designs]{.alert} due to sample constraints
  - [Non-compliance]{.alert} with treatment protocols
- Solutions:
  - [Pre-registered flexibility]{.alert} for exploratory analysis
  - [Sensitivity analyses]{.alert} for robustness checks
  - Clear [attrition management]{.alert} strategies

## When experiments are not possible

:::{style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"}

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The [experimental ideal]{.alert} is not always feasible
  - [Ethical constraints]{.alert}, [logistical challenges]{.alert}, [political barriers]{.alert}
- [Natural experiments]{.alert}: When "nature" (broadly speaking) does the randomisation
  - [Examples]{.alert}: Earthquakes, hurricanes, pandemics
  - [More examples]{.alert}: Political transitions, policy changes, civil wars
- [Quasi-experiments]{.alert}: Broader term than natural experiments, sometimes we can control the treatment but not the assignment
  - [Examples]{.alert}: School vouchers, minimum wage laws, health interventions
  - [Methods to estimate causal effects]{.alert}: Difference-in-differences, regression discontinuity, instrumental variables
- They are [somewhere between observational and experimental studies]{.alert}, and have received increased attention in the last decades

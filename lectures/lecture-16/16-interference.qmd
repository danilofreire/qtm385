- Remember [SUTVA]{.alert}?
  - [Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption]{.alert}
- The [stable]{.alert} part means that [potential outcomes for any unit are unaffected by the treatment status of other units]{.alert}
- As you can imagine, this [poses risks to causal identification]{.alert}

## A motivating example

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Imagine you are trying to improve school grades
- You think that [awarding a prize to students]{.alert} will help motivate them
- You randomly assign students to treatment and control groups
- You find a [positive effect]{.alert} of the programme on test scores
- But you also find that [depending on who gets the treatment]{.alert}, the [effect varies]{.alert}

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; text-align: center;"}

| Student | Grades if Alice wins prize | Grades if Bob wins prize | Grades if Charlie wins prize | Grades if no prize awarded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alice | 10 | 5 | 7 | 7 |
| Bob | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Charlie | 9 | 5 | 9 | 9 |
:::
:::

## Example

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 21px;"}
- You find that the results [vary depending on who wins the prize]{.alert}
- Let's calculate the ATEs in this case?

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; text-align: center;"}

| Student | Grades if Alice wins prize | Grades if Bob wins prize | Grades if Charlie wins prize | Grades if no prize awarded |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alice | 10 | 5 | 7 | 7 |
| Bob | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |
| Charlie | 9 | 5 | 9 | 9 |
:::

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::

- If we simply calculate the ATE using the last column as $Y_{i}(0)$ and the column corresponding to $i$'s award as $Y_{i}(1)$, we have: $\frac{((10 - 7) + (5 - 5) + (9 - 9))}{3} = 1$
- [However...]{.alert} if we randomise the treatment, we have these results:
- If Alice wins the prize, the ATE is $10 - \frac{5+9}{2} = 3$
- If Bob wins the prize, the ATE is $5 - \frac{5+5}{2} = 0$
- If Charlie wins the prize, the ATE is $9 - \frac{7+5}{2} = 3$
- The average of these three is $2$, which is [different from the first calculation]{.alert}
:::

## Not all spillovers are bad!

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- As we have seen, many social phenomena are [interdependent]{.alert}
- But some are explicitly [designed to leverage spillovers]{.alert}
  - [Contamination]{.alert}: The effect of being vaccinated on one’s probability of contracting a disease depends on whether others are vaccinated
  - [Network effects]{.alert}: The value of a product or service increases as more people use it (social media, telecommunication)
  - [Hot-spots policing]{.alert}: The effect of increased police presence in one area can reduce crime in nearby areas
  - [Deterrence]{.alert}: The effect of a harsher punishment on one individual can deter others from committing crimes

# How to deal with interference? (good and bad!) {background-color="#2d4563"}

## How to deal with interference?

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Interference can be a nuisance, but also an [opportunity]{.alert}
- So it is a good idea to [model it explicitly]{.alert} in our analysis
- In this case, we wouldn't need to assume "no spillovers", but rather ["not modelled spillovers"]{.alert}
- [Good design]{.alert} can help us leverage spillovers to our advantage
- There are several methods to do this:
  - [Clustered randomisation]{.alert} (this one you already know!)
  - [Multi-level designs]{.alert} (e.g., schools within districts)
  - [Within-subject designs]{.alert} (e.g., repeated measures)
  - [Waitlist designs]{.alert} (e.g., staggered rollouts)
- Let's see them in more detail 😎
:::

## Multi-level designs

:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 29px;"}
- Multi-level designs are [nested]{.alert} experiments
- This means that we have [multiple levels of randomisation]{.alert}
- For example, in a [school-based intervention]{.alert}:
  - Schools are randomised to treatment or control
  - Within schools, students are also randomised
- Political interventions can also be nested:
  - We randomise the treatment at the district level
  - Then we randomise the treatment again at the voter level
- But we need to [expand our potential outcomes notation]{.alert} to account for this...
:::

## An example
### Get-out-to-vote campaign

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Imagine we are running an experiment to test the effect of a get-out-to-vote campaign on voter turnout
- We have a [multi-level design]{.alert}:
  - [Households]{.alert} are randomised to treatment or control
  - Within households, [individuals]{.alert} are also randomised
- Focus on [two-voter households]{.alert} where residents share addresses
- Random assignment groups:
  - [5,000 households: both voters targeted]{.alert}
  - [5,000 households: neither targeted]{.alert}
  - [10,000 households: one randomly targeted]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Creates four 10,000-person groups:
  - [Mail received by both]{.alert}
  - [Neither receives mail]{.alert}
  - [Mail with untreated housemate]{.alert}
  - [Untreated with treated housemate]{.alert}
- So we have:
  - [Two-stage randomisation]{.alert} (household then individual)
  - Expandable to [additional levels like postcode]{.alert}

## An example
### Get-out-to-vote campaign

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- [Potential outcomes depend on both own and housemate's treatment status]{.alert}
- Revised notation system accounts for [dual treatment influences]{.alert} ($Y_{ab}$) where:
  - `a` = [housemate's treatment status (0=control, 1=treated)]{.alert}
  - `b` = [own treatment status (0=control, 1=treated)]{.alert}

| Notation | Housemate | Self | Interpretation |
|----------|-----------|-----|----------------|
| $Y_{00}$ | Control   | Control | [Baseline outcome]{.alert} |
| $Y_{01}$ | Control   | Treated | [Direct treatment effect]{.alert} |
| $Y_{10}$ | Treated   | Control | [Spillover effect]{.alert} |
| $Y_{11}$ | Treated   | Treated | [Combined effects]{.alert} |

- Key assumption: [Strict household containment]{.alert}
  - Outcomes only affected by [within-household interventions]{.alert}
  - No interference from [external treatment assignments]{.alert}
:::

## Defining causal effects

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- From the [four potential outcomes]{.alert}, some interesting estimands emerge:
  - $Y_{01} - Y_{00}$: [Direct effect]{.alert} of treatment when housemate is untreated
  - $Y_{11} - Y_{10}$: [Treatment effect]{.alert} when housemate receives mail
  - $Y_{10} - Y_{00}$: [Spillover effect]{.alert} on untreated with treated housemate
  - $Y_{11} - Y_{01}$: [Spillover interaction]{.alert} among treated pairs

- Critical considerations:
  - Effects depend on [housemate's treatment status]{.alert}
  - Estimands capture [combined influences]{.alert} of:
    - Direct intervention impacts
    - Communication spillovers
    - Shared resource effects
  - Does _not_ isolate specific [mechanisms]{.alert} behind spillovers
:::

## Implementation challenges
### Practical considerations

- Common implementation hurdles:
  - [Treatment contamination]{.alert} between groups

  - [Equity implications]{.alert} of spillover effects
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Design limitations to address:

# Spatial spillovers {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Spatial spillovers

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- So far, we have [weakened the SUTVA assumption]{.alert} by considering interference in a small setting (households)
- Sometimes, spillovers are not confined to specific units, but [spread across space]{.alert}
- This is particularly common in [urban settings]{.alert}:
  - [Crime]{.alert} in adjacent neighbourhoods
  - [Pollution]{.alert} in nearby areas
  - [Economic development]{.alert} in neighbouring regions
  - [Health outcomes]{.alert} in surrounding communities
- While it seems tempting to just include a measure of proximity in our models, it is not that simple...
  - Not easy to be very precise about spillover effects
  - Not valid when spillovers are not spatially confined (e.g., pollution)
  - Physical proximity does not always make sense (e.g., social networks, phones)
:::

## Motivating example

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 23px;"}
- Imagine you want to improve healthcare in five villages
- Assume also that the proper distance between villages is known, so this is not a spatial problem
- Subjects reside in villages A, B, C, D and F, and E is unoccupied
- [Only one village will receive the treatment]{.alert}, which is a new healthcare facility
- There are [three types of potential outcomes:]{.alert}
  - $Y_{01}$: Healthcare level of village X if it receives the treatment
  - $Y_{10}$: Healthcare level of village X if the adjacent village receives the treatment
  - $Y_{00}$: Healthcare level of village X if village X or its neighbours do not receive the treatment

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/villages.png){width=90%}
:::
:::

## Potential outcomes

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
| Village | Untreated ($Y_{00}$) | Adjacent village treated ($Y_{10}$) | Treated ($Y_{01}$) |
|---|---|---|---|
| A | 0 | 2 | 0 |
| B | 6 | 2 | 10 |
| C | 0 | 4 | 4 |
| D | 6 | 6 | 6 |
| F | 6 | NA | 3 |
:::

- Notice that [some villages can never have some outcomes]{.alert}
- [Village E is unoccupied]{.alert}, so it is not included in the analysis
- NA indicates that [Village F can never be adjacent to a treated village]{.alert}
- In this case, location F can never manifest a $Y_{10}$ outcome 
- As this potential outcome can never be observed, we exclude F from the definition of the average treatment effect $E[Y_{10} - Y_{00}]$
:::

## Potential outcomes

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Second, the [probability of assignment to each treatment condition varies from one observation to the next]{.alert}
- For instance, village A has a 0.20 probability of being exposed to spillovers from B, whereas village B has a 0.40 probability because of A and C
- As we have seen previously, when the treatment assignment probabilities vary across units, we should [weight observations by inverse probability of assigned experimental condition]{.alert}, excluding subjects with zero probability (e.g., F)


:::{style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center;"}
| Village | A | B  | C | D | F | Pr(assignment to control) | Pr(assignment to spillover) | Pr(assignment to treatment) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | $Y_{01}$ | $Y_{10}$ | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{00}$ | 0.6 | 0.2 | 0.2 |
| 2 | $Y_{10}$ | $Y_{01}$ | $Y_{10}$ | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{00}$ | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.2 |
| 3 | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{10}$ | $Y_{01}$ | $Y_{10}$ | $Y_{00}$ | 0.4 | 0.4 | 0.2 |
| 4 | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{10}$ | $Y_{01}$ | $Y_{00}$ | 0.6 | 0.2 | 0.2 |
| 5 | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{00}$ | $Y_{01}$ | 0.8 | 0   | 0.2 |
:::
:::

## Calculating $Y_{01} - Y_{00}$ and $Y_{10} - Y_{00}$
### Average and spillover effects

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Now we can calculate the average treatment effect in the presence of spillovers
- We need to [weight the observations]{.alert} by the inverse probability of assignment to the treatment condition
- Imagine that [Village D is treated]{.alert}
- Villages A, B and F have $Y_{00}$ as the potential outcome, as they are not directly affected by spillovers
- Village C, in contrast, is not included in the calculation because it does not have a $Y_{00}$ potential outcome (untreated), but expresses a $Y_{10}$ potential outcome instead (spillover effect)
- The weighted difference-in-means estimator of $E[Y_{01} - Y_{00}]$ adjusts for the fact that the probabilities of being untreated are 0.60, 0.40, and 0.80 for Villages 1, 2, and 5, respectively
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- So the effect is:

$$
\hat{E}[Y_{01} - Y_{00}] = \frac{\frac{6}{0.2}}{\frac{1}{0.2}} - \frac{\frac{0}{0.6} + \frac{6}{0.4} + \frac{6}{0.8}}{\frac{1}{0.6} + \frac{1}{0.4} + \frac{1}{0.8}} = 1.85.
$$

- If we wanted to [estimate the spillover effect]{.alert}, we would calculate $E[Y_{10} - Y_{00}]$ instead
- Village D is treated, so we would exclude it from the calculation
- Village F is also excluded as it cannot be adjacent to a treated village

$$
\hat{E}[Y_{10} - Y_{00}] = \frac{\frac{4}{0.4}}{\frac{1}{0.4}} - \frac{\frac{0}{0.6} + \frac{6}{0.4}}{\frac{1}{0.6} + \frac{1}{0.4}} = 0.40.
$$

# Within-subject designs and repeated-measures experiments {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Within-subject designs

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Within-subject designs]{.alert} are a type of study that [repeatedly measures the same subjects]{.alert} over time and [randomisation occurs at a certain point in time]{.alert}
- The good thing about this design is that it [controls for individual differences]{.alert} that could confound the results
- This type of experiment is rather uncommon in the social sciences, but it is [quite common in psychology]{.alert}
- Instead, social scientists usually rely on [interrupted time-series designs]{.alert} to study the effects of interventions
- This is similar to a [regression discontinuity in time]{.alert}
- Let's see how they work... (and why they are a bit problematic)
:::

![](figures/its.png){width=90%}

Source: <https://ds4ps.org/pe4ps-textbook/docs/p-020-time-series.html>
:::

- The problem with this design is that it is [hard to establish causality]{.alert}
- [Confounding factors]{.alert} can affect the results, as something may [change at the same time as the intervention]{.alert}
:::
:::
:::

## Within-subject designs
### Assumptions

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- The key assumption in within-subject designs is that [the intervention is the only thing that changes]{.alert}
- Therefore, we need to make [two additional assumptions]{.alert}:
  - [No-anticipation]{.alert}: Subjects do not know when the intervention will occur, so they cannot change their behaviour in anticipation
  - For example, if we are studying the effect of a new policy on crime rates, we need to make sure that criminals do not know when the policy will be implemented
  - [No persistence]{.alert}: Potential outcomes in one period are unaffected by treatments administered in prior periods
  - This is a bit tricky, as we are assuming that the effect of the treatment [disappears after a certain period]{.alert}
  - Experimenters often include ["washout periods" between experimental sessions]{.alert} so as to allow the previous
period's effects to dissipate
:::

## Variations of repeated-measures experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- [Clifford et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0003055421000241) evaluate how different "pre-post" designs can improve experimental estimates, mainly by reducing standard errors
- Regular experiments ("post only") have relatively low precision because [the outcome is measured just once]{.alert}
- This is particularly problematic when the outcome is [noisy]{.alert} or if the experiment involves [multiple treatment arms, moderators, or small treatment effects]{.alert}
- Pre-post designs measure the outcome prior to the experimental manipulation at point $t_0$ and after the manipulation at point $t_1$ (as we've just seen)
-  The pre-post design [can also be a between-subjects design]{.alert} if [some respondents are never exposed to the treatment]{.alert}; respondents difference scores are compared between groups
:::

## Variations of time-series experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Some scholars worry that measuring the outcome prior to the experiment could [alter estimated treatment effects]{.alert}
- This is true in some cases: [the no-persistence assumption is likely violated]{.alert} when the treatment gives information or training, for example
- The [quasi-pre-post design]{.alert} is a variation of the pre-post design that tries to avoids this problem by providing a [similar, but not identical, treatment]{.alert} in the pretest phase
  - For instance, a training session on a related but different topic
- The authors decided to test these designs in a [replication of six studies]{.alert} to see how they perform in practice
- If different designs yield largely the same results, researchers can be more confident in the external validity of these findings and choose designs based [on other features, like precision]{.alert}

# Waitlist designs {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Waitlist designs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- The final type of design we will discuss today is the [waitlist design]{.alert}, also known as the [stepped-wedge design]{.alert}
- Their scientific value comes from their [ability to track treatment effects among several subjects as they play out over time]{.alert}
- Waitlists play a diplomatic role because they [overcome the problem of withholding treatment from a control group]{.alert} (remember our ethics discussion?)
- In this design, every subject is treated eventually; [random assignment determines when they receive treatment]{.alert}
- It is a [hybrid between a within-subject and a between-subject design]{.alert}, and it is [widely used in public health interventions]{.alert} (e.g., vaccine rollouts)

- There are just [three relevant potential outcomes]{.alert}: 
  - $Y_{00}$: untreated during preceding and current periods
  - $Y_{01}$: untreated during the preceding period but treated during the current period
  - $Y_{11}$: treated in both the preceding and current periods
  - Given the design, we never observe the potential outcome $Y_{10}$ because media markets never cease to run ads once they start

## Estimating the immediate effect of TV advertising

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- The immediate treatment effect is $Y_{01} - Y_{00}$, that is, the effect of being treated in the current period but not in the preceding period
- We just need to take the numbers from the tables and apply inverse probability weighting again

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{E}[Y_{01} - Y_{00}] &= \frac{\frac{7 + 10}{0.25} + \frac{2 + 1}{0.25} + \frac{7 + 10}{0.25}}{\frac{2}{0.25} + \frac{2}{0.25} + \frac{2}{0.25}} \\
&- \frac{\frac{7 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3}{0.75} + \frac{5 + 3 + 3 + 3}{0.50} + \frac{3 + 4}{0.25}}{\frac{6}{0.75} + \frac{4}{0.50} + \frac{2}{0.25}} = 2.72.
\end{aligned}

## Estimating the cumulative effect of TV advertising

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Finally, we will estimate the cumulative effect of TV advertising, which is $Y_{11} - Y_{00}$, that is, the effect of being treated in both the preceding and current periods
- We do the same thing again, but now we consider the $Y_{11}$ potential outcomes
- However, we must restrict our attention to the second and third weeks, because this type of treatment cannot occur
in the first week

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{E}[Y_{11} - Y_{00}] &= \frac{\frac{9 + 8}{0.25} + \frac{4 + 10 + 10 + 3}{0.50}}{\frac{2}{0.25} + \frac{4}{0.50}} \\
&- \frac{\frac{5 + 3 + 3 + 3}{0.50} + \frac{3 + 4}{0.25}}{\frac{4}{0.50} + \frac{2}{0.25}} = 4.13.

## Conclusion

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 28px;"}
- [Spillovers]{.alert} are a common problem in social science research
- They can be [positive or negative]{.alert}, and they can be [modelled explicitly]{.alert} in our analysis
- There are several methods to deal with spillovers, such as [multi-level designs]{.alert}, [within-subject designs]{.alert}, [repeated-measures experiments]{.alert}, and [waitlist designs]{.alert}
- Each design has its [advantages and disadvantages]{.alert}, and the choice of design should be based on the [research question]{.alert} and the [context]{.alert}
- You can use [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/) to simulate spillover designs and pretest–posttest designs
- The statistical analysis of waitlist designs is a little tricky, but you can use the [swCRTdesign](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/swCRTdesign/index.html) package in R to help you with that

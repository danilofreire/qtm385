# Brief recap üìö {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Blocking recap

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- **Blocking** involves [grouping experimental units based on certain characteristics]{.alert} to ensure comparability between treatment and control groups.
- Blocks are formed based on variables expected to affect the outcome, and [within each block, units are randomly assigned]{.alert} to treatment or control.
- Blocking [reduces variance]{.alert} and [increases precision]{.alert} by ensuring balanced groups within each block.
- Key benefits:
  - Ensures [equal representation]{.alert} of important subgroups in treatment and control.
  - Reduces the risk of confounding variables affecting results.
  - Particularly useful for [small sample sizes]{.alert} or when heterogeneity is expected.

## Clustering recap

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- **Clustering** involves assigning [whole groups of units to treatment and control]{.alert}, often due to practical constraints.
- Common in experiments where individual randomisation is impossible (e.g., classrooms, villages).
- Clustering introduces [intra-cluster correlation (ICC)]{.alert}, which measures how similar individuals within the same cluster are.
- Challenges:
  - [Higher variance]{.alert} compared to individual randomisation.
  - Requires [robust clustered standard errors]{.alert} to avoid underestimating uncertainty.
- Blocking can be used within clusters to further [reduce variance]{.alert} and improve precision.

# Clustering (cont.) {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Clustering (cont.)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Last class, we discussed the concept of clustering in experiments
- Clustering is often used when [random assignment is not feasible]{.alert}, such as in:
  - Education (e.g., classrooms)
  - Healthcare (e.g., hospitals)
  - Community interventions (e.g., neighbourhoods)
- Clustering can be beneficial, but it also [comes with challenges]{.alert}, such as the need for robust statistical methods to account for intra-cluster correlation
- We also discussed the importance of considering [the design effect]{.alert} when planning a clustered experiment
  - We unfortunately [lose statistical power]{.alert} when we cluster
- Clustering is [more of a necessity than a choice]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The [intra-cluster correlation (ICC)]{.alert} is a measure of the similarity of individuals within the same cluster, compared to individuals in different clusters
- The ICC is defined as:
  - $ICC = \frac{\sigma^2_{between}}{\sigma^2_{between} + \sigma^2_{within}}$
- The measure goes from 0 to 1. When it is closer to 0, it means that clusters have [no influence]{.alert} on the outcome, so we can treat individuals as independent
  - This is the ideal situation!
- When it is closer to 1, it means that all units within the same cluster have [the same outcome]{.alert}
  - This is not good because it implies that units are so similar that the [effective sample size is equal to the number of clusters]{.alert}
- ICCs are always between these two, but the larger it is, the more we need to account for it

## Clustering (cont.)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- As we've seen, cluster randomised trials entail a series of [specific challenges]{.alert} for standard estimation and testing methods
- If randomisation is conducted at [the cluster level]{.alert}, the uncertainty arising from this process is also at [the cluster level]{.alert}
- When we have a sufficient number of clusters, [cluster robust standard errors]{.alert} can help us produce confidence intervals with the correct coverage. However, these require a [large number of clusters]{.alert}
- If the cluster size (or any related characteristic) is linked to the effect magnitude, then the estimation may be [biased]{.alert} (and adjustments are required)
- So, what can we do? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
:::

## What to do in such situations?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- One option is to [increase the sample size]{.alert} to account for the loss of power due to clustering
- This can be done by:
  - [Adding more clusters]{.alert}
  - [Increasing the number of units within each cluster]{.alert}
- However, this can be challenging in practice, as it may not always be feasible to add more clusters or units
- And this is where blocking comes in!
- Blocking can be used to [reduce variance]{.alert} within clusters, which can help to mitigate the loss of power due to clustering
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Imai et al (2009)](https://projecteuclid.org/journals/statistical-science/volume-24/issue-1/The-Essential-Role-of-Pair-Matching-in-Cluster-Randomized-Experiments/10.1214/08-STS274.pdf) proposed a design suggestion to improve the efficiency of cluster randomised trials
- The strategy has three steps:
  - First, choose the causal quantity of interest (usually, individual difference in means)
  - Then, [identify available pre-treatment covariates]{.alert} likely to affect the outcome variable ([blocks]{.alert}), and, if possible, [pair clusters based on the similarity of these covariates and cluster sizes]{.alert}
  - They show that this step is usually overlooked and can yield many additional observations
  - Finally, researchers should randomly choose [one treated and one control cluster within each pair]{.alert}

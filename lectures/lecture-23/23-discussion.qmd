# Hello, everyone! üòâ {background-color="#2d4563"}

# More about the group project {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Some suggestions for the presentation

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- The presentation should be [about 10 minutes long]{.alert}
- You can use as many slides as you want, but please try to keep it short (most slides should be 1-2 minutes long)
- You can use any software you want (PowerPoint, Google Slides, etc.), but Quarto is preferred üòâ
- My suggestion is to use the following format for your slides:
  - Title
  - Introduction
  - Research question and hypotheses
  - Methods
  - Results
  - Discussion
  - Conclusion
- But these are just suggestions, so feel free to change the format if you want üòä
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- Please remember the order of the group presentations:
  - [Wednesday, the 23rd of April: Groups 1, 4, 5 and 6]{.alert}
  - [Monday, the 28th of April: Groups 2, 3, 7 and 8]{.alert}
- We will also have about [5 minutes for questions after each presentation]{.alert}
- Please remember to [submit your slides]{.alert} by the day of the presentation. If you can [do it the day before]{.alert}, that would be great!
- Best of luck with your presentations! I am sure you will do great! üòä

# Brief recap üìö {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Survey experiments for sensitive topics

:::{style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- [Sensitive topics]{.alert} are difficult to study!
- [Social desirability bias]{.alert} is a common problem in survey research
- [List experiments]{.alert} measure prevalence indirectly through item counts
- [Randomised response]{.alert} techniques use probability models for anonymity
- [Endorsement experiments]{.alert} assess support without direct attribution
- [Conjoint analysis]{.alert} measures preferences through trade-off scenarios
- Maintain [plausible deniability]{.alert} for respondents
- Software to estimate these models: <http://sensitivequestions.org/>

# Today's plan üìÖ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Texts for discussion

:::{style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Today we have four texts for discussion:
- Druckman, J. N., Gilli, M., Klar, S., & Robison, J. (2015). [Measuring drug and alcohol use among college student‚Äêathletes.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ssqu.12135) Social Science Quarterly, 96(2), 369-380.
- Blair, G., Imai, K., & Lyall, J. (2014). [Comparing and Combining List and Endorsement Experiments: Evidence from Afghanistan.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ajps.12086) American Journal of Political Science, Vol. 58, No. 4 (October), pp. 1043-1063.

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- All four papers are about sensitive topics and use the methods we discussed in class
- The first uses a [list experiment]{.alert} to measure underreporting of drug and alcohol use amongst atheletes (a major problem in athletics!)
- The second paper is a more sophisticated one: the authors use two methods to measure support for NATO forces in Afghanistan (a sensitive topic indeed!)
- The third paper uses a clever design, leveraging a referendum in the US to see which method is better to measure sensitive topics (spoiler: randomised response is the best one!)
- The last one, by yours truly, addresses a major problem in developing countries: support for extralegal violence
- And I can say that the issue seems not to be that sensitive to a lot of respondents üòÖ
- I hope they are useful and interesting for you! üòä

## Measuring drug and alcohol use

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- Do young athletes really tell how much they drink and use drugs?
- [Of course not!]{.alert} üòÇ
- What is interesting about this experiment is that the difference between [direct questions]{.alert} and [list experiments is huge!]{.alert}
- This raises some other questions, and I would like to hear your thoughts on them!
- So let's have a closer look at their experiment!

## Experimental design

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- As you can expect, the authors use a [list experiment in this article]{.alert}
- Their sample comes from [12 major universities competing in the Division I NCAA Athletics]{.alert}
- They accessed the athletic websites of all 12 Big Ten schools and obtained [the full rosters for all sports at every school]{.alert}
- The authors located 6,375 names on rosters, and after discarding emails that bounced back, ended up with [4,093 e-mail addresses]{.alert}
- They sent the survey to all of these athletes, and received [1,303 responses]{.alert} (~31% response rate, not bad!)
- [Questions]{.alert}:
  - Is it okay to collect emails from the internet and send unsolicited surveys?
  - What are the pros and cons of this approach?
  - How would you analyse the data? ATE or ITT?
  - The authors also argue that "_the experimental nature of our key measurement approach means that obtaining a perfectly representative sample is of much less importance than is the random assignment of our experimental treatment between groups_" (p. 374). [Do you agree with this statement?]{.alert}
:::

## UCLA survey

:::{style="font-size: 26px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- The authors first measure the prevalence of drug and alcohol use in the [College Senior Survey 2009]{.alert}
  - The CSS is a survey of college seniors conducted by the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA
  - Sample includes 24,457 individuals from 111 colleges and universities
- [Student-athletes are substantially less likely‚Äîin self-reports‚Äîto drink beer or use drugs than their non-athlete peers]{.alert} (p. 374)
- "_Nearly 75 percent of the general student population say they ‚Äúfrequently‚Äù or ‚Äúoccasionally‚Äù drink beer,
whereas only 46 percent of our student-athlete sample say the same_ ($z = 20.55; p <0.01$)" (p. 374)
- [Does that surprise you?]{.alert}
:::

## List experiment
### Drug use

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
Below is a list of activities that you may have engaged in over your time in college. 
We are interested in HOW MANY of these activities you have engaged ‚Äì NOT which ones. 
Thus, please simply choose the number at the end of the list. 

* Sustained an injury during a practice or game that prevented you from playing at least one other game

* Joined a social club whose majority of members did/does not include varsity athletes

* Skipped a class because you felt so tired from a practice or a game

* Was unable to take a class that you hoped to take because of your practice or game schedule

* [Knowingly took a drug banned by the NCAA that may improve your athletic performance]{.alert}
:::

## Results
### Drug use

:::{style="font-size: 28px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Note that the authors asked about [knowingly taking a drug banned by the NCAA]{.alert}
- [The results were stark]{.alert}:
  -  Control group = mean response of 3.31 (SD = 0.78; n = 553) 
  -  Treatment group = mean response of 3.68 (SD = 0.98; n = 510). 
  -  The difference between the two groups is statistically significant ($t_{1061}$ = 6.90; p < 0.01)
  -  The authors conclude that the list experiment "_suggests that 37 percent of respondents have knowingly taken banned drugs_" (p. 377)
- [Direct question]{.alert} =  4.9 percent üòÇ
- [What do you think about this result?]{.alert}
:::

## List experiment
### Alcohol use

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
Below is a list of activities that you may have engaged in over your time in college. 
We are interested in HOW MANY of these activities you have engaged ‚Äì NOT which ones. 
Thus, please simply choose the number at the end of the list. 

* Your choice of which University to attend was determined largely by the sports opportunities (e.g., it weighed in at least in 50% of your decision)
* Stayed up past 1 AM, on average, during the season of your sport
* Plan to continue playing your sport after college, although not necessarily on the professional level
* Play other sports during the school year at least once a month
* [In the typical week during the past academic year, consumed more than five alcoholic drinks]{.alert}
:::

## Results
### Alcohol use

:::{style="font-size: 28px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Again, [large statistical difference]{.alert}:
  - Control group = mean response of 2.76 (SD = 0.85; n = 544) 
  - Treatment group = mean response of 3.22 (SD = 1.10; n = 556). 
  - [46 percent consumed more than five drinks a week]{.alert}
- Less than [3 percent]{.alert} of athletes reported that they consumed more than five drinks a week when asked directly

# Combining list and endorsement experiments {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Comparing and combining list and endorsement experiments: evidence from Afghanistan
### Interviewing the Taliban!

:::{style="font-size: 26px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- This paper is both a substantive and methodological contribution
- Their main methodological contribution is to [compare (and eventually combine)]{.alert} list and endorsement experiments
- The setting is pretty challenging, too: [Afghanistan]{.alert}
- Motivation: regime change, "hearts and minds" campaign, and the Taliban
- Outcome: [support for the Taliban and foreign (NATO) forces]{.alert} (ISAF)
- Here, for the sake of time, we will focus on [their experimental design]{.alert}, but I encourage you to read the paper! ü§ì
- Note: all models were estimated with the [list](https://list.sensitivequestions.org/) and [endorse](https://endorse.sensitivequestions.org/) R packages
:::

## Experimental design

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### List experiment

I‚Äôm going to read you a list with the names of different groups and individuals on it.  After I read the entire list, I‚Äôd like you to tell me how many of these groups and individuals you broadly support, meaning that you generally agree with the goals and policies of the group or individual. Please don‚Äôt tell me which ones you generally agree with; only tell me how many groups or individuals you broadly support.

Karzai Government; National Solidarity Program; Local Farmers; [Foreign Forces]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Endorsement experiment

A recent proposal [by ISAF]{.alert} calls for the sweeping reform of the Afghan prison system, including the construction of new prisons in every district to help alleviate overcrowding in existing facilities. Though expensive, new programs for inmates would also be offered, and new judges and prosecutors would be trained. How do you feel about this proposal?

- From strongly disagree to strongly agree (5-point scale)
:::
:::

- Respondents also had the option to say "Refuse to answer" or "Don't know"
- Refusal rates were very low (about 6%) when compared to direct questions

## Results

:::{style="font-size: 29px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- These are [very interesting results]{.alert}!
- Taliban victimisation leads to a [modest increase in support for ISAF]{.alert}
- [ISAF victimisation is associated with a consistently negative effect across all models]{.alert}
- List experiment model estimates a modest positive effect, suggesting that Taliban post-harm efforts may actually be associated with an increase in ISAF support; the endorsement experiment model suggests the opposite!
- Interestingly, [the authors don't know exactly why this happens]{.alert} üòÇ
- So maybe we need a "cleaner" design to understand this better?

# Empirical Validation of Survey Methodologies for Sensitive Questions {background-color="#2d4563"}

## An empirical validation study of popular survey methodologies for sensitive questions
### Randomised response vs. list experiment vs. endorsement experiment

:::{style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- Now we have a [different paper]{.alert} that compares the three methods we discussed in class
- The findings suggest that the [choice of method can significantly impact the results]{.alert}
- And who's the winner? [Randomised response!]{.alert}
- The authors leveraged a [referendum in the Mississippi]{.alert} to test the three methods
- Since the [true value of the outcome is known]{.alert}, they could compare the results of the three methods
- It was an [anti-abortion referendum]{.alert}, and the three methods yielded estimates much closer to the true value

- Why do people accept lynching as a form of punishment?
- Vigilantism happens in many developing countries and it has [serious social consequences]{.alert}
- It [undermines the rule of law]{.alert}, [deepens group conflict]{.alert}, and [can lead to cycles of violence]{.alert}
- We use a [mixed-methods approach]{.alert}, mainly a [conjoint experiment]{.alert} to see under which conditions Brazilians believe [lynching is justified]{.alert}

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/){.alert} is a package for R that helps you design and analyse experiments
- We have already used it before, but today we will see more of its capabilities
- As we will see, DeclareDesign is a powerful tool to plan and execute experiments
  - It helps you define your research question and hypotheses
  - It guides you in choosing the right design and sample size
  - It provides tools to analyse your data and draw conclusions
- And it is simulation-based, so you can test your design before running the experiment
- I hope you can use it in your pre-analysis plans! 😉

# Quarto 📝 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What is Quarto?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- Quarto (`.qmd`) is a document format that combines the best features of R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks
- It is designed for [reproducibility and literate programming]{.alert}, as mentioned before
- [Literate programming]{.alert} is a programming paradigm that combines code and documentation in a single document
  - This makes your code more readable and easier to maintain
  - It also helps you communicate your results more effectively
- [If you use R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks, you already do literate programming!]{.alert}
- Why is literate programming important for experimental research?
  - It helps you [keep track of your code and results]{.alert}
  - It makes it easier to [share your work with others]{.alert}
  - It allows you to [reproduce your analysis and results]{.alert}
:::

## Why Quarto?
### Can't I just use R Markdown or Jupyter Notebooks instead?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- [Yes, you can!]{.alert} 
- But Quarto has some advantages over R Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks
- For example, Quarto supports [multiple programming languages]{.alert} (not just R and Python)
- It also has built-in support for [interactive visualisations]{.alert} and [data tables]{.alert}
- And it is designed to work well with [version control systems]{.alert} like Git
- You can also use it to [publish your documents online](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) (like this one!), create [slideshows](https://quarto.org/docs/slides/), [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), and [books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/)
- [Learn it once, use it everywhere!]{.alert} 🤓
:::

## How to get started with Quarto?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- First, you need to [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
- It is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux
- If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can install Quarto with `brew install quarto`
- In case you use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), you can install the [Quarto extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=quarto.quarto-vscode) too, which will save you a lot of time
- You can also use [Quarto in RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/rstudio/)
- As [Quarto was created by the same people who made RStudio](https://posit.co/blog/announcing-quarto-a-new-scientific-and-technical-publishing-system/), it is very easy to use it in RStudio
  - Just install the [Quarto R package](https://quarto.org/docs/r-package/) and you are good to go!
  - `install.packages("quarto")`

# Writing a Quarto document 📝 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## How to write a Quarto document?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Quarto documents are directly influenced by R Markdown
- All documents have three main components:
  - YAML header with metadata
  - Markdown content (text)
  - Code chunks (R, Python, Julia, etc.)
- [YAML](https://yaml.org/){.alert} stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language"
  - It is a human-readable data serialisation format
  - It is often used for configuration files and metadata
  - In Quarto, the YAML header contains information about the document (title, author, date, etc.)
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
```markdown

## PDFs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
- Most articles and reports are in PDF format
- You will need a [LaTeX distribution](https://www.latex-project.org/get) to create PDFs
- You can install it with `quarto`:
  - `quarto install tinytex`
- If you use `R`, you can use [`tinytex`](https://yihui.org/tinytex/) with: 
  - `install.packages("tinytex")`
  - `tinytex::install_tinytex()`
- This is [strongly recommended]{.alert} as a LaTeX distribution is huge and takes a long time to install
- More information [here](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html)

## Adding references

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- You can add academic references to your documents using `BibTeX`
- `BibTeX` is a reference management software developed for LaTeX
- A `BibTeX` file is a plain text file with `.bib` extension
- You can add references to your YAML header
- Use `@key` to cite a reference, `[@key]` to cite in parentheses
- The key is the first line of the reference in the `.bib` file (e.g., `@article{nash1950equilibrium,...}`). The key here is `nash1950equilibrium`
- More information [here](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/references.html)
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The easiest way to manage references is with a reference manager like [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) or download a BibTeX reference from Google Scholar
- Just search for a paper and click on the `cite` button
- Then click on `BibTeX` and copy the reference to your `.bib` file
:::
:::

## Example

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
![](figures/scholar.png)

![](figures/citation.png)

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
```bibtex
@article{nash1950equilibrium,
  title={Equilibrium points in n-person games},
  author={Nash Jr, John F},
  journal={Proceedings of the national academy of sciences},
  volume={36},
  number={1},
  pages={48--49},
  year={1950},
  publisher={National Acad Sciences}
}
```

- Save it on your `references.bib` file (or any other name, as long as you reference it in your YAML header and the file ends with `.bib`)
- Quarto will automatically format the references
- More information about BibTeX [here](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_bibtex)

# DeclareDesign 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What is DeclareDesign?
### A package for designing and analysing data

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/){.alert} is an `R` package that helps you design and analyse experiments, quasi-experiments, and other observational studies
- Its main goal is to provide [tools for declaration, diagnosis, and redesign in code]{.alert}, that is, to help you plan and execute your research before data analysis
- DeclareDesign can be thought of in 2 parts
  - [The data fabrication step]{.alert} (this is the bulk of the code)
  - [The evaluation step]{.alert}, where users can change initial assumptions and see how well their design actually worked (this is the computationally intensive part of the code)
- The great thing about DeclareDesign is that you can simulate [any kind of design]{.alert} you can think of (e.g., experiments, regression discontinuity, difference-in-differences, even qualitative research!)
- However, most studies are not that complex, so you will rarely need to use all of DeclareDesign's capabilities
- The authors have written a [book](https://declaredesign.org/library/) that explains the package in detail
- And they have also created a companion package, [DesignLibrary](https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/), with pre-built designs that you can use right away! 🤓
:::

## Six components of a DeclareDesign study

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [Population]{.alert}: Set of units about which inferences are sought and their characteristics
  - Where should the theory apply? Who are the units of interest?
- [Potential outcomes]{.alert}: Outcomes each unit might exhibit depending on how causal process changes the world
  - Rooted in theory; non-compliance, spillovers and attrition [affect potential outcomes]{.alert}
- [Sampling strategy]{.alert}: Strategy used to select units to include in study
  - How are we selecting units to analyse?
- [Assignment]{.alert}: Manner in which units are assigned to reveal one potential outcome or another
  - Randomisation strategy used
- [Estimand]{.alert}: Quantities that we want to learn about in the world, in terms of potential outcomes
  - What are we trying to estimate? ATE? Difference in means? Other quantities?
- [Estimator]{.alert}: Procedure for generating estimates of the quantities we want to learn about
  - This is your statistical model (e.g., OLS, IV, etc.)
:::

## DeclareDesign in action

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- First, you need to install DeclareDesign with `install.packages("DeclareDesign")` and DesignLibrary with `install.packages("DesignLibrary")`
- Under the hood, DeclareDesign uses `fabricatr` to generate data, `randomizr` to randomise units, and `estimatr` to estimate causal effects
- All functions start with `declare_`, and you can chain them together with `+`
- Once you have your design, you can run it with `diagnose_design` and `draw_data`
- Then you can also use `ggplot2` to visualise your results or `dplyr` to summarise them
- The authors have written a [tutorial](https://declaredesign.org/getting-started/) that explains how to use DeclareDesign
- And they have also created a [gallery](https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/) with examples of different designs
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
| Design component | Function        | Description                     |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| Model           | `declare_model()` | background variables and potential outcomes |
| Inquiry         | `declare_inquiry()` | research questions                |
| Data strategy   | `declare_sampling()` | sampling procedures              |
|                 | `declare_assignment()` | assignment procedures            |
|                 | `declare_measurement()` | measurement procedures           |
| Answer strategy | `declare_estimator()` | estimation procedures            |
|                 | `declare_test()`   | testing procedures               |
:::

[Chapter 18 of the book](https://book.declaredesign.org/library/experimental-causal.html#sec-ch18s1) explains how to use DeclareDesign for experimental causal inference. Lots of examples! Some we are going to see today 🤓

# DesignLibrary 📚 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## DesignLibrary
### Making your life easier!

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- [DesignLibrary](https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/){.alert} is a companion package to DeclareDesign and it includes several common designs
- You can use these designs as templates for your own experiments!
- Let's see how to create a simple [two-arm experiment with DesignLibrary](https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/reference/two_arm_designer.html)

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
library(DesignLibrary)

# two_arm_designer(
  # N = 100,
  # assignment_prob = 0.5,
  # control_mean = 0,
  # control_sd = 1,
  # ate = 1,
  # treatment_mean = control_mean + ate,
  # treatment_sd = control_sd,
  # rho = 1,
  # args_to_fix = NULL
# )

two_arm_design <- two_arm_designer(ate = 2, N = 1000)

two_arm_design
```

## DesignLibrary
### Clustered designs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- You can create complex designs easily too!

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# A design with varying block size and varying cluster size
cluster_sampling_design <- cluster_sampling_designer(
  N_blocks = 2,
  N_clusters_in_block = 100,
  N_i_in_cluster = 50,
  n_clusters_in_block = 10,
  n_i_in_cluster = 10,
  icc = 0.1)

# DesignWizard 🧙 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## DesignWizard

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- Our friends at DeclareDesign have created a tool called [DesignWizard](https://eos.wzb.eu/ipi/DDWizard/) that can help you create and diagnose designs interactively
- It's a great way to get started with DeclareDesign [without writing any code!]{.alert}
- DesignWizard asks a few questions about your research goals and then generates the corresponding DeclareDesign code for you
- It even generates the simulations and diagnoses for you automatically!
- [Give it a try!]{.alert} 🧙

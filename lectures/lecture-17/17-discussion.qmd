:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Spillovers]{.alert} are a common problem in social science research
- They can be [positive or negative]{.alert}, and they can be [modelled explicitly]{.alert} in our analysis
- There are several methods to deal with spillovers, such as [multi-level designs]{.alert}, [within-subject designs]{.alert}, [repeated-measures experiments]{.alert}, and [waitlist designs]{.alert}
- Each design has its [advantages and disadvantages]{.alert}, and the choice of design should be based on the [research question]{.alert} and the [context]{.alert}
- You can use [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/r/designlibrary/) to simulate spillover designs and pretest posttest designs
- The statistical analysis of waitlist designs are a little tricky, but you can use the [swCRTdesign](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/swCRTdesign/index.html) package in R to help you with that

# Waitlist designs {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Waitlist designs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- The final type of design we will discuss today is the [waitlist design]{.alert}, also known as the [stepped-wedge design]{.alert}
- Their scientific value comes from their [ability to track treatment effects among several subjects as they play out over time]{.alert}
- Waitlists play a diplomatic role because they [overcome the problem of withholding treatment from a control group]{.alert} (remember our ethics discussion?)
- In this design, every subject is treated eventually; [random assignment determines when they receive treatment]{.alert}
- It is a [hybrid between a within-subject and a between-subject design]{.alert}, and it is [widely used in public health interventions]{.alert} (e.g., vaccine rollouts)

## Example: TV advertising and candidate support

:::{style="margin-top: 22px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Imagine you are a political consultant and you want to test the [effect of TV advertising on candidate support]{.alert}
- Ads are aired during [three weeks]{.alert}, and outcomes (support for the gubernatorial candidate as gauged by opinion polls) are [assessed at the end of each week]{.alert}
- Eight media markets are randomly assigned to [one of four conditions]{.alert}:
  - [Two media markets]{.alert} are randomly assigned to air ads for three weeks starting in [week 1]{.alert}
  - [Two markets]{.alert} air ads for two weeks starting in [week 2]{.alert}
  - [Two markets]{.alert} air ads for one week starting in [week 3]{.alert}
  - And [two markets air no ads at all]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- There are just [three relevant potential outcomes]{.alert}: 
  - $Y_{00}$: untreated during preceding and current periods
  - $Y_{01}$: untreated during the preceding period but treated during the current period
  - $Y_{11}$: treated in both the preceding and current periods
  - Given the design, we never observe the potential outcome $Y_{10}$ because media markets never cease to run ads once they start

|---|---|---|---|
| Pr(00) | 0.75 | 0.50 | 0.25 |
| Pr(01) | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.25 |
| Pr(11) | 0 | 0.25 | 0.50 |
:::

## Estimating the immediate effect of TV advertising

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- The immediate treatment effect is $Y_{01} - Y_{00}$, that is, the effect of being treated in the current period but not in the preceding period
- We just need to take the numbers from the tables and apply inverse probability weighting again

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{E}[Y_{01} - Y_{00}] &= \frac{\frac{7 + 10}{0.25} + \frac{2 + 1}{0.25} + \frac{7 + 10}{0.25}}{\frac{2}{0.25} + \frac{2}{0.25} + \frac{2}{0.25}} \\
&- \frac{\frac{7 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3}{0.75} + \frac{5 + 3 + 3 + 3}{0.50} + \frac{3 + 4}{0.25}}{\frac{6}{0.75} + \frac{4}{0.50} + \frac{2}{0.25}} = 2.72.
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

## Estimating the cumulative effect of TV advertising

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Finally, we will estimate the cumulative effect of TV advertising, which is $Y_{11} - Y_{00}$, that is, the effect of being treated in both the preceding and current periods
- We do the same thing again, but now we consider the $Y_{11}$ potential outcomes
- However, we must restrict our attention to the second and third weeks, because this type of treatment cannot occur
in the first week

$$
\begin{aligned}
\widehat{E}[Y_{11} - Y_{00}] &= \frac{\frac{9 + 8}{0.25} + \frac{4 + 10 + 10 + 3}{0.50}}{\frac{2}{0.25} + \frac{4}{0.50}} \\
&- \frac{\frac{5 + 3 + 3 + 3}{0.50} + \frac{3 + 4}{0.25}}{\frac{4}{0.50} + \frac{2}{0.25}} = 4.13.

## Centola (2010)
### The Spread of Behavior in an Online Social Network Experiment

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [How do social networks affect the spread of behaviour?]{.alert}
- Do tight-knit or loose-knit networks facilitate the spread of behaviour?
  - Clustered networks can spread behaviour more quickly than random networks because they have more connections and reinforce each other
  - In contrast, weak ties can spread behaviour more widely than strong ties because they connect different clusters
  - "Strength of weak ties" (Granovetter, 1973): paradoxical idea that weak ties can be more valuable than strong ties in spreading information

## Research design

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px;"}
- [Can you easily manipulate the network structure?]{.alert}
- Not always, but you can use [random assignment to create different network structures]{.alert}
- The author [created an online health community]{.alert} with 1528 participants recruited from internet forums
- All participants were anonymous and were partnered with "health buddies" to share information about health behaviours
- Participants made decisions about whether or not to adopt a health behaviour based on the adoption patterns of their
health buddies
- The health behavior used for this study was the decision to register for an Internet-based health forum 
- [What do you think of this design so far?]{.alert}
:::

## Research design

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px;"}
- The author assigned participants to one of two network structures:
  - [Clustered network]{.alert} with highly connected participants
  - [Random network]{.alert} with weak ties between participants
- Treatment was assigned before the experiment started and [participants were not aware of their treatment assignment]{.alert}
- The author claim the design is better than observational studies because it [eliminates confounding variables]{.alert} such as
  - Personality traits
  - Geographic location
  - Advertising and pricing
  - Changes in the networks over time
- [Can you do the same with massive data from social media?]{.alert}
:::

## Research design

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Diffusion was initiated by [selecting a random “seed node”,]{.alert} which sent signals to its network neighbours encouraging them to adopt a health-related behaviour
- Every time a participant adopted the behaviour (i.e., registered for the health forum), [messages were sent to their health buddies inviting them to adopt]{.alert}
- If a participant had multiple health buddies who adopted the behaviour, then they would receive multiple signals, one from each neighbour
- The more neighbors who adopted, the more reinforcing signals a participant received
- The author [measured the fraction of participants who adopted the behaviour]{.alert}

:::

## Discussion

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px;"}
- The author [concludes that clustered networks are more effective than random networks]{.alert} in spreading behaviour
- But there are some limitations to this study, too
- [Can you think of any?]{.alert}
- [Can you think of policy implications?]{.alert}

- [How can we change community-wide patterns of behaviour?]{.alert} (again!)
- Focus on [adolescent school conflict]{.alert} - verbal/physical aggression, rumour-mongering, social exclusion
- Existing interventions target [individual psychology]{.alert} (persuasion), [mass education]{.alert}, or [institutional regulation]{.alert} 
- This study explores a [social influence strategy]{.alert}: 
  - Seed a social network with individuals demonstrating new behaviours 
  - Rely on social influence to spread behaviour through network structures 
- [Key question]{.alert}: Can a small group of influential people shift a community's behavioural climate?

## Research design

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px;"} 
- [Multilevel experiment]{.alert} across 56 US middle schools (24,191 students) 
  - [Randomised at school level]{.alert} (treatment vs. control) 
  - [Randomised at student level within treatment schools]{.alert} (seed students) 
- Comprehensive measurement of [school social networks]{.alert} before intervention 
- "Who do you choose to spend time with?" - measures attention in network 
- Identified "social referents" - top 10% most connected students in each school 
- Intervention: [Anti-conflict campaign]{.alert} driven by seed students 
- Encouraged public stance against conflict 
- Seed students (20-32 per school in treatment schools) were selected to participate 
- Intervention activities: creating slogans, posters, wristbands
:::

## Intervention details

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 28px;"} 
- [Grassroots campaign approach]{.alert}
- Seed students identified school-specific conflict behaviours 
- Developed slogans and posters 
- Distributed wristbands as rewards for positive behaviour 
- [No top-down, adult-defined problems]{.alert}: focused on student perspectives 
- Standardised procedures with trained facilitators using scripts and activity guides 
- High attendance at meetings (average >55% of invited students) 
- Made meetings engaging: snacks, hands-on activities, technology
:::

## Measures

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"} 
- [Outcomes measured subjectively and administratively]{.alert} 
- [Subjective]{.alert}: student-reported norms about conflict (pre/post surveys) 
- Descriptive norms: how many students participate in conflict? 
- Prescriptive norms: how many students disapprove of conflict? 
- [Administrative]{.alert}: school disciplinary records of peer conflict events (across the year) 
- [Focus on disciplinary events as a key behavioural outcome]{.alert} 
- Arguably less susceptible to reporting bias than self-reported conflict
:::

## Results

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/paluk-results.png){width=100%}
:::

## Results

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 26px;"} 
- [Significant reduction in disciplinary reports]{.alert} in treatment schools [~30% reduction overall]{.alert} 
- Effect stronger when seed groups contained more "social referent" students 
- [Increased talking about conflict reduction]{.alert} and wearing wristbands in treatment schools
- [No average differences in social norms]{.alert} between treatment and control schools initially
- [Social referent seeds were more influential]{.alert} than other seed students 
  - 20% social referent seeds -> 60% reduction in disciplinary events
- Students exposed to social referent seeds more likely to: 
  - Report friends discussing conflict reduction 
  - Perceive stronger anti-conflict norms 
  - Wear wristbands
- [No peer-to-peer influence effect on discipline directly]{.alert} (climate-level effect stronger)
:::

## Results

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/paluk-results2.png){width=100%}
:::

## Interpretation

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"} 
- [Intervention shifted school climate]{.alert} - widespread behavioural pattern 
- [Social referents key to norm and behaviour change]{.alert} 
- Outsized influence due to attention from peers 
- Not just structural position, but also traits and experiences 
- [Norms findings nuanced]{.alert}: 
  - No overall shift in norms between schools 
  - But within treatment schools, norms did shift, especially via social referents 
  - Possible "signal" effect of intervention - increased attention to conflict, leading to revised norm evaluations
:::

## Implications

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"} 
- [Peer influence]{.alert} interventions can be effective in reducing school conflict 
- [Importance of social referents]{.alert} in changing behaviour 
- Target these individuals in interventions for greater impact 
- [Highlights the usefulness of student-led initiatives]{.alert} 
- Grassroots approach can be more effective than top-down 
- [Methodological contribution]{.alert}: 
- Demonstrates rigorous social network experiment in real-world setting 
- Multilevel randomisation for causal inference in networks
:::

## Limitations

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"} 
- [What are some potential limitations of this study?]{.alert} 
- Generalisability to other contexts? (different types of conflict, schools, cultures) 
- Long-term effects? 
- Mechanism of change fully understood?
- Reliance on disciplinary records - are these fully objective? 
- Ethical considerations of network interventions? (manipulation of social structures?) 
- What about the students who were not selected as "seeds" but were still part of the network? Were they affected negatively?

## Research design

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Large-scale field experiment]{.alert} in New Haven, Connecticut (1998 election)
    - [~30,000 registered voters]{.alert}
    - [Random assignment at household level]{.alert} to different GOTV treatments & control
- [2x2x4 Factorial Design]{.alert}:
    - [Personal Canvassing]{.alert} 
    - [Telephone Calls]{.alert}
    - [Direct Mail]{.alert} (None, One, Two, or Three mailings)
- [Non-partisan messages]{.alert} used for all treatments
    - Civic duty, close election, neighbourhood solidarity appeals
- [Outcome]{.alert}: Validated voter turnout from official records
:::

## GOTV treatment details

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 27px;"}
- [Personal Canvassing]{.alert}:
    - Paid canvassers (grad students) in pairs, weekends before election
    - Targeted specific households, not entire streets
    - Varied message appeals (civic duty, close election, neighbourhood solidarity)
    - Contact rate: ~28%
- [Direct Mail]{.alert}:
    - Postcards designed by political consulting firm
    - Varied number of mailings (1, 2, or 3) and message appeals
- [Telephone Calls]{.alert}:
    - Out-of-state telemarketing firm, calls in days before election
    - Scripted calls, civic duty and close election appeals only
    - Contact rate: ~32% (reached household)
:::

## Addressing contact rates - Instrumental variables

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Issue]{.alert}: Not everyone in treatment groups actually *received* treatment
    - Simply comparing contacted vs. non-contacted inflates effect 
- [Solution]{.alert}: Two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression using *intent-to-treat* as instrument
    - Instrument: Random assignment to treatment group (yes/no)
    - Endogenous variable: Actual contact (yes/no)
- [Rationale]{.alert}: Random assignment predicts contact, but is uncorrelated with other reasons for turnout (no direct effect on turnout except through treatment)
- Allows for [causal estimation of treatment effect *accounting for* non-compliance]{.alert} (non-contact)
:::

## Main effects

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Personal Canvassing Highly Effective]{.alert}:
    - +8.7 percentage points increase in turnout (2SLS estimate)
    - ~9.8 points in multivariate model
    - Most effective GOTV method tested
- [Direct Mail Shows Small Effect]{.alert}:
    - +0.6 points per mailing (multivariate model)
    - Small but statistically significant
    - Cumulative effect of 3 mailings ~ 2.5 points (probit)
- [Telephone Calls Ineffective]{.alert}:
    - No significant effect, slight negative effect in some models
    - Despite professional firm and mirrored messaging
:::

## Message and cost-effectiveness

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Message Type Mattered Little for Personal Canvassing]{.alert}:
    - Civic duty, close election, neighbourhood solidarity appeals similarly effective (though close election slightly higher)
    - No significant interaction effects between treatments
- [Cost-Effectiveness Analysis]{.alert}:
    - Personal canvassing: ~$8 per *additional* vote
    - Direct mail (3 mailings): ~$40 per *additional* vote
    - Face-to-face mobilisation significantly more cost-effective
:::

## Interpretation

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Supports Hypothesis]{.alert}: Personal canvassing > impersonal methods for turnout
    - Decline in face-to-face mobilisation may contribute to turnout decline
- [Unexpected Finding]{.alert}: Ineffectiveness of telephone calls
    - Despite professional execution & mirroring canvassing messages
    - Possible reasons: Routinized/scripted nature, out-of-state callers
- [Mechanism of Personal Canvassing Effect?]{.alert}
    - Speculation: Salience, memorability, connection, urgency... (future research needed)
- [Limitations]{.alert}: Non-partisan messages, specific election context, short-term effects
:::

## Implications

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Personal canvassing is a valuable GOTV tool]{.alert}
    - More effective & cost-effective than mail/phone
- [Challenges conventional wisdom?]{.alert} -  Heavy reliance on mail/phone in modern campaigns
- [Highlights importance of *personal* connection]{.alert} in political mobilisation
- [Methodological Contribution]{.alert}:
    - Rigorous field experiment in political science
    - Addresses non-compliance with IV approach
- [Future Research]{.alert}: Explore mechanisms, partisan vs. non-partisan, long-term effects, interactions of methods

:::

## Limitations

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [What are potential limitations of this text?]{.alert}
    - Generalisability to other elections/contexts?
    - Focus on *turnout* only - what about vote choice/persuasion?
    - Short-term effects only - sustained impact?
    - Specific message content -  would different messages work better for mail/phone?
    - Ethical considerations of GOTV experiments? (Manipulation of voters?)
    - Hawthorne effect of canvassing? (People vote more because of the *attention*, not just the message)

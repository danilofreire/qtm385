:::{.column width=50%}

- A good research question should produce [knowledge that solves real-world problems]{.alert} and guides policy decisions, with a [practical and credible research design]{.alert}

- [Theory]{.alert} is essential in research design, whether implicit or explicit, as it helps generate hypotheses, informs design choices, and guides inference strategies

- [Operationalisation]{.alert} is the process of translating theoretical concepts into measurable variables, such as turning "social isolation" into the frequency of social interactions

- [Pre-registration]{.alert} involves filing research designs and hypotheses publicly to reduce bias, improve credibility, and distinguish between pre-planned and exploratory analyses

- The [reproducibility crisis]{.alert} in science highlights the need for transparent and replicable research, with pre-registration and pre-analysis plans helping address this issue

:::
:::{.column width=50%}

- The [EGAP research design form](https://egap.github.io/learningdays-resources/Exercises/design-form.html) provides a blueprint for creating robust research designs, covering key components like hypotheses, population, intervention, outcomes, and analysis

- The [MIDA framework](https://book.declaredesign.org/introduction/what-is-a-research-design.html#mida-the-four-elements-of-a-research-design) (Model, Inquiry, Data, Answer) helps researchers simulate and diagnose their designs before implementation, ensuring they can answer their research questions effectively

- [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/) is a tool that allows researchers to declare, diagnose, and design their studies using the MIDA framework, improving the quality and credibility of research

- A [two-arm trial]{.alert} is a common experimental design where units are randomly assigned to treatment or control groups, and the average treatment effect (ATE) is estimated

- [Alignment]{.alert} between research design and theoretical frameworks is necessary for generating credible and actionable results, even when experiments are not feasible

# Do hospitals make people sicker? üè• {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Imagine you are a health economist...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- ... and you want to know whether the government should invest in building more hospitals
- You measure the sample's health status: poor, fair, good, very good, or excellent? (the higher, the better)
- And you find this:

|              | Hospital | No Hospital | Difference |
|--------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Health status| 3.21     | 3.93        | ‚àí0.72‚àó‚àó‚àó   |
|              | (0.014)  | (0.003)     |            |
| Observations | 7,774    | 90,049      |            |

<br>

- A simple comparison of means suggests that going to the hospital makes people worse off: those who had a hospital stay in the last 6 months are, on average, less healthy than those that were not admitted to the hospital
- The difference is statistically significant at the 1% level
- [But don't dismiss the idea just yet!]{.alert}
- [What could be going on here?]{.alert}
:::

## Potential outcomes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- We are interested in the relationship between [treatment]{.alert} $T$ and some outcome that may be impacted by the treatment (eg. health)

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::

- Outcome of interest:
  - $Y$ = outcome we are interested in studying (e.g. health)
  - $Y_i$ = value of outcome of interest for individual $i$

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::

- For each individual, there are [two potential outcomes]{.alert}:
  - $Y_{0,i}$ = outcome if individual $i$ does not receive treatment
  - $Y_{1,i}$ = outcome if individual $i$ does receive treatment

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::
- So the treatment effect for individual $i$ is:
  - $\tau_{i} = Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}$
:::

## Potential outcomes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Alejandro has a broken leg
- He has two potential outcomes:
  - $Y_{0,a}$ = If he doesn‚Äôt go to the hospital, his leg doesn‚Äôt heal properly
  - [$Y_{1,a}$ = If he goes to the hospital, his leg heals completely]{.alert}

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::

- Benicio doesn‚Äôt have any broken bones. His health is fine
- He also has two potential outcomes:
  - $Y_{0,b}$ = If he doesn‚Äôt go to the hospital, his health is still fine
  - [$Y_{1,b}$ = If he goes to the hospital, his health is still fine]{.alert}

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::
- [The fundamental problem of causal inference]{.alert}:
  - _We never observe both potential outcomes for the same individual_
  - Creates [a missing data problem]{.alert} if we compare treated to untreated
:::

## The fundamental problem of causal inference

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- For any individual, we can only observe [one potential outcome]{.alert}:

$$
Y_i = 
\begin{cases} 
Y_{0i} & \text{if } T_i = 0 \\
Y_{1i} & \text{if } T_i = 1 
\end{cases}
$$

where $T_i$ is a treatment indicator equal to 1 if $i$ was treated and 0 otherwise

- Each individual either participates in the programme or not

- The causal impact of programme $T$ on $i$ is:

$$
Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}
$$

- We only observe $i$'s actual outcome:

$$
Y_i = Y_{0i} + (Y_{1i} - Y_{0i}) T_i
$$

**Example:** Alejandro goes to the hospital, Benicio does not.
:::

## Establishing causality

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- In an ideal world (research-wise), we could clone each treated individual and observe the impacts of treatment on the outcomes of interest

:::{style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"}
![](figures/lisa.png){width=30%}
:::

- But we can't clone people (yet üòÇ), so we need to find a way to estimate the treatment effect using the data we have
- What is the impact of giving Lisa a textbook on her test scores? üìö
  - Impact = Lisa‚Äôs score with a book - Lisa‚Äôs score without a book
- In the real world, we either observe Lisa with a textbook or without a textbook, but not both
- [We never observe the counterfactual]{.alert}
:::

## Establishing causality

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- To measure the causal impact of giving Lisa a book on her test score, we need to find a similar child that did not receive a book

:::{style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px;"}
![](figures/bart.png){width=30%}
:::

- Our estimate of the impact of the book is then the difference in test scores between the treatment group and the comparison group
  - Impact = Lisa‚Äôs score with a book - Bart‚Äôs score without a book

- As this example illustrates, finding a good comparison group is hard
  - [Your research design is your counterfactual]{.alert}
:::

## Average causal effects

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- What we actually want to know is the [average causal effect]{.alert}, but that is not what we get from a difference in means comparison.

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::

**Difference in group means**

- Average causal effect of program on participants + selection bias

Even in a large sample:

- People will choose to participate in a program when they expect the program to make them better off (i.e., when $Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i} > 0$).

- The people who choose to participate are likely to be different than those who choose not to... *even in the absence of the program*
:::

## Selection bias: example

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/tab01.png){width=40%}
:::

## Selection bias: example

:::

## Selection bias: example

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/tab03.png){width=90%}
:::

## Mathematically speaking...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- The [mathematical expectation]{.alert} of $Y_i$ is $E[Y_i]$
- Equivalent to sample average in an infinite population
  - Example: probability coin flipped lands heads = 0.5
  - A six-sided die rolled = 3.5 (although no side has 3.5 dots)
  - Equivalent to fraction heads after a (very) large number of flips ("long-run average")
  - $E[Y_i] = \sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i/N$

- [Law of large numbers]{.alert}: sample average converges to population average as sample size increases
  - $E[Y_i] = \lim_{N \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i/N$
  - $E[Y_i] = \lim_{N \to \infty} \bar{Y}$
- In small samples, average of $Y_i$ might be anything
- Average of $Y_i$ gets very close to $E[Y_i]$ as number of observations (that we are averaging over) gets large
- [Bias]{.alert} = difference between expected value of an estimator and the true value of the parameter being estimated
  - $Bias = E[\hat{\theta}] - \theta$
:::

## The Central Limit Theorem visualised

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Imagine we simulate a uniform distribution of numbers from 0 to 9
- The expected value of this distribution is 4.5
- As we increase the number of simulations, you'll see that the average of the numbers converges to 4.5

:::
:::

## Conditional expectations

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [Conditional expectation]{.alert} of $Y_i$ given $X_i$ is $E[Y_i|X_i]$
- The conditional expectation of $Y_i$ given a variable $X_i = x$, is the average of $Y_i$ in an infinite population that has $X_i = x$
- $E[Y_i|X_i = x] = \sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_i/N$ for all $i$ such that $X_i = x$

<br>

- Example:
  - $X_i =1$ if individual $i$ is treated, 0 otherwise
  - $E[Y_i|X_i = 1]$ = average outcome for treated individuals
  - $E[Y_i|X_i = 0]$ = average outcome for untreated individuals
  - $E[Y_i|X_i = 1] - E[Y_i|X_i = 0]$ = average treatment effect
:::

## Selection bias (this time with maths)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- When we compare (many) participants to (many) non-participants:

## Two types of counterfactuals

:::{style="margin-top: 60px; font-size: 30px;"}
- Participant vs. Non-Participant comparisons (we just saw why this is problematic)

<br>

- Pre-treatment vs. Post-treatment comparisons (why?)

<br>

- Extremely strong (read: often completely unreasonable) assumptions are required to make either of these impact evaluation approaches credible

## Millennium development villages

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- [Millennium Villages Project (MVP)](https://www.un.org/esa/coordination/Alliance/Earth%20Institute%20-%20The%20Millennium%20Villages%20Project.htm) (2004-2015) was a UN project to demonstrate that integrated, community-led development could improve health, education, and agriculture in rural Africa
- First evaluation relied on data on pre-treatment and post-treatment outcomes in Bar Sauri, Kenya
- On most outcomes people living in the MDV looked better after a 3-5 years

## How to estimate causal effects

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Quasi-experimental approaches

- **Difference-in-difference estimation**
  - [Idea]{.alert}: Combine pre/post + treated/untreated designs
  - [Requirement]{.alert}: Common trends in treatment, comparison groups

- **Instrumental variables**
  - [Idea]{.alert}: Find a source of exogenous variation in treatment
  - [Requirement]{.alert}: A valid instrument (satisfying the exclusion restriction)

- **Regression discontinuity**
  - [Idea]{.alert}: Exploit explicit rules (cutoffs) for assigning treatment
  - [Requirement]{.alert}: The existence of discontinuity
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Alternative approaches

- **Conditional independence assumption (CIA) approaches**
  - Machine estimators, i.e., [propensity score matching]{.alert}
  - Coefficient stability robustness to controls

- **Explicit models** (structural or not) of selection into treatment

- **Natural experiments** when treatment is as-good-as-random
  - Example: [Rainfall shocks in childhood]{.alert} (Maccini and Yang 2009)
  - Closely related to instrumental variables approach
:::
:::
:::

## How to estimate causal effects
### Experimental approach

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}

- Random assignment to treatment
  - Eligibility for program is determined at random, e.g., via [pulling names out of a hat]{.alert}

- The Law of Large Numbers
  - A [sample average]{.alert} can be brought as close as we like to the [population mean]{.alert} just by enlarging the sample
  - Mathematically: $\bar{Y} \to E[Y_i] \quad \text{as} \quad N \to \infty$

- Treatment and control groups
- When treatment status is randomly assigned:
  - Treatment and control groups are [random samples]{.alert} of a single population
  - Example: The population of all eligible applicants for the program.

- Expected outcomes
- In the absence of the program, [expected outcomes]{.alert} are equal for both groups
  - Formally: $E[Y_i | \text{Treatment}] = E[Y_i | \text{Control}]$
:::

## Random assignment

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Randomisation does not eliminating individual difference (we still can‚Äôt identify [individual treatment effects]{.alert})¬à 
- On average, individuals in treatment/control are similar (in large samples)¬à
- Need [Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA)]{.alert}: Potential outcomes for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units (more later)
- See [Imbens and Rubin (2015)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/causal-inference-for-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences/71126BE90C58F1A431FE9B2DD07938AB?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark) for more details
- When is SUTVA violated?
  - Spillovers
  - Non-compliance
  - Interference
  - Contamination
  - Heterogeneous treatment effects
- We will see all that in the next lectures! ü§ì
:::

## Violations of SUTVA

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### SUTVA: ‚Äústable unit‚Äù part
- Individuals are receiving [the same treatment]{.alert} ‚Äì i.e., the ‚Äúdose‚Äù of the treatment to
each member of the treatment group is the same
- If we are estimating the effect of hospitalisation on health status, [we assume everyone is getting the same dose of the hospitalisation treatment]{.alert}¬à 
- Easy to imagine violations if hospital quality varies across individuals 
- Have to be careful what we are and are not defining as the treatment
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### SUTVA: ‚Äútreatment value‚Äù part
- The potential outcomes for any unit do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units
- [No spillovers]{.alert}: The treatment of one individual does not affect the outcomes of others (e.g., a vaccinated person cannot indirectly protect unvaccinated neighbours)
- [No interference]{.alert}: Units' treatments do not influence each other's outcomes through direct interaction or competition
- [No contamination]{.alert}: Control group members do not receive any form of the treatment, either intentionally or accidentally
:::
:::
:::

## Partial equilibrium

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [Partial equilibrium]{.alert} is a concept from economics
- It refers to the idea that the effects of a policy or intervention are limited to the individuals directly affected by it
- In the context of SUTVA, partial equilibrium means that the treatment effect for one group [may not generalise to other groups]{.alert}
- Issue of [external validity]{.alert}
- Let‚Äôs say we estimate a causal effect of early childhood intervention in some area
- Now adopt it for the whole country ‚Äì will it have the same effect as we found?
  - Expansion may create general equilibrium effects
  - Have different effects due to economies of scale
  - The effect might be different if the population is different
:::

# Recap: back to our hospital example üè• {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Potential outcomes revisited

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Main question: do hospitals make people sicker?

- [Heterogeneous treatment effects]{.alert}: treatments work differently for different people
  - Sick people benefit more from hospitals (e.g., broken bones, infections)
  - Healthy people might even be *harmed* by hospitals (e.g., stress, exposure to germs) 

- Real-World Example:  
  - Imagine two people:  
    - *Alejandro* (sick): Hospital fixes his broken leg ‚Üí improves his health  
    - *Benicio* (healthy): Hospital visit causes anxiety ‚Üí slightly worsens his health  

- [Takeaway]{.alert}:  
  - Treatments don‚Äôt work the same way for everyone 
  - If we only study people who *choose* treatment (like sick people), results are misleading.  
:::

## Potential outcomes for hospital visits

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [What would happen if everyone went to the hospital vs. no one?]{.alert}

- Potential outcomes table:

<br>

  | **Person** | **Outcome if Hospitalised** | **Outcome if Not Hospitalised** |  
  |------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
  | Sick       | Health improves slightly      | Health stays poor                |  
  | Healthy    | Health slightly worsens       | Health stays fine                |  

<br>

- The Problem:
  - We only observe *one outcome* per person (e.g., we see Alejandro‚Äôs health *after* he goes to the hospital, but not what would‚Äôve happened if he didn‚Äôt)

- [Selection Bias]{.alert}: Sick people *choose* hospitals, making comparisons unfair
:::

## How random assignment fixes this

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Randomisation breaks the link between treatment choice and outcomes

- (An absurd) experiment:
  - [What if we randomly assign *everyone* (sick and healthy) to two groups]{.alert}?
    - **Treatment group**: Must go to the hospital
    - **Control group**: Cannot go to the hospital  
  - Afterward, compare average health of both groups  

- Randomisation ensures groups are *similar* on average (similar mix of sick/healthy people)  
- Any difference in outcomes is *caused by the hospital*, not pre-existing health

- But [what are we measuring here?]{.alert}

:::{.incremental}
- The average effect of hospitalisation on the population
:::
:::

## Randomising amongst the sick

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [What if we only randomise treatment for people who need it?]{.alert}

- **Better Experiment**:  
  - Only include *sick people* in the study  
  - Randomly assign half to hospitals, half to stay home  

- **Result**:  
  - Compare health of hospitalised sick people vs. non-hospitalised sick people 

- [What are we measuring now? Is this the ideal experiment?]{.alert}

:::{.incremental}
- The average effect of hospitalisation on sick people
- **Limitation**:  
  - Doesn‚Äôt tell us how hospitals affect healthy people (but they don‚Äôt need hospitals anyway!)
:::
:::

## People do not always follow the rules

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}

- [We might consider randomising access to hospitals]{.alert}

- But what if people ignore their random assignment?

- **Example**:  
  - Assign 100 sick people to hospitals, but 40 refuse to go 
  - Assign 100 sick people to stay home, but 20 go to hospitals anyway

- **Problem**:  
  - The ‚Äútreated‚Äù group now includes *only those who complied* (e.g., the most severe cases)
  - The ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù group includes some people who sought treatment 

- **Result**:  
  - The measured effect applies only to *compliers* (e.g., very sick people)
  - The effect might not apply to everyone 

- This is the [compliance problem]{.alert} in experiments
:::

## Why compliance matters for real-world policy

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Even with random assignment, human behaviour (often) complicates things 

- Example: A government offers free training to help people find jobs
  - Random assignment: Some people get training, others do not
  - Reality: Only 30% of the treatment group actually attend the training and get jobs

- [Should we continue the programme?]{.alert}
  
- Two ways to analyse:
  - [Intent-to-Treat (ITT)]{.alert}: Compare *all* people assigned to treatment vs. control (even if they didn‚Äôt go).  
     - Shows the effect of *offering* the program.  
  - [Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT)]{.alert}: Compare only those who *actually took* the treatment vs. control
     - Shows the effect for *compliers* 

- **Takeaway**: Compliance affects how we interpret results and design policies.  
:::

## To sum up...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- [Potential outcomes]{.alert} help us understand the causal effects of treatments
- The [fundamental problem of causal inference]{.alert} is that we never observe both potential outcomes for the same individual
- [Random assignment]{.alert} helps us estimate causal effects by breaking the link between treatment choice and outcomes
- [Selection bias]{.alert} occurs when treated and untreated groups are different in the absence of treatment
- [SUTVA]{.alert} is a key assumption in causal inference that ensures potential outcomes do not vary with the treatments assigned to other units
- [Compliance]{.alert} affects how we interpret results and design policies
- [Partial equilibrium]{.alert} is the idea that the effects of a policy or intervention are limited to the individuals directly affected by it
- [External validity]{.alert} is the extent to which the results of a study can be generalised to other populations, settings, and times

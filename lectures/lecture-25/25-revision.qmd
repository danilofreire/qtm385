# Foundations 🏗️ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The research design process (Lec 02)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- Good research questions produce [knowledge people care about]{.alert}, solving problems or helping policy
- Research questions should be [clear, specific, and answerable]{.alert}
- [No experiment is theory-free]{.alert}, even if not explicitly stated
- [Operationalisation]{.alert} involves translating abstract concepts (e.g., social isolation) into measurable variables (e.g., frequency of social interactions)
  - [Construct validity]{.alert} ensures the measure accurately reflects the concept
- Credible designs yield practical answers, are transparent via pre-registration ([PAPs]{.alert}), and are replicable

## The MIDA framework (Lec 02 cont)

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
- The [MIDA framework]{.alert} provides a structure for declaring and diagnosing any research design:
    - [M]{.alert}odel: Assumptions about how the world works (potential outcomes, relationships)
    - [I]{.alert}nquiry: The specific question (estimand) we want to answer (e.g., ATE)
    - [D]{.alert}ata Strategy: How data are generated (sampling, treatment assignment)
    - [A]{.alert}nswer Strategy: The estimator used to answer the inquiry from the data (e.g., difference-in-means, regression)
- Using MIDA in code (with `DeclareDesign`) allows simulating the design to understand its properties (bias, power, etc.) *before* implementation

## Potential outcomes & causality (Lec 03)

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="60%"}
- The [Potential Outcomes (PO)]{.alert} framework is what we use for defining causal effects
    - For each unit $i$, there's an outcome if treated ($Y_i(1)$) and an outcome if untreated ($Y_i(0)$)
    - The individual treatment effect is $\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$
- The [Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference]{.alert} states we only observe *one* potential outcome per unit ($Y_i = Y_i(1)Z_i + Y_i(0)(1-Z_i)$)
- Causality is inherently a [missing data problem]{.alert}
- Our goal is often to estimate population averages, like the Average Treatment Effect ([ATE]{.alert}): $ATE = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)]$

## Selection bias & SUTVA (Lec 03 cont)

:::{style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- [Selection bias]{.alert} arises when comparing groups that differ systematically *before* treatment (e.g., sicker people choosing hospitals), biasing simple comparisons
- [Randomisation breaks the link between potential outcomes and treatment receipt]{.alert}, making groups comparable on average (in expectation) on all pre-treatment characteristics
- This allows [unbiased ATE estimation]{.alert} via difference-in-means
- [SUTVA]{.alert} (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption):
    - [No interference]{.alert} between units (one unit's treatment doesn't affect another's outcome)
    - [Consistent treatment value]{.alert} (the treatment is the same for all units receiving it)
:::

:::{.column width="60%"}
:::{style="text-align: center; margin-top: -30px;"}
![](figures/dag-1.png){width="100%"}

a) [Confounding]{.alert}: Underlying illness ($Z$) causes both taking a specific drug ($X$) and experiencing a bad outcome ($Y$)
b) [Mediation]{.alert}: Smoking ($X$) causes lung damage ($Z$), which then leads to breathing difficulties ($Y$)
c) [Collision]{.alert}: A student's talent ($X$) influences their grades ($Y$); both talent ($X$) and grades ($Y$) influence getting a scholarship ($Z$) – selecting only scholarship winners ($Z$) distorts the observed talent-grade relationship
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Selection bias (Lec 04)

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 20px;"}
1. Start with the observed difference in means:
   $E[Y_i|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i|Z_i=0]$
2. Substitute observed outcomes with potential outcomes based on treatment status:
   $= E[Y_i(1)|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=0]$
3. Add and subtract the counterfactual for the treated group ($E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=1]$):
   $= E[Y_i(1)|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=1] + E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=0]$
4. Group the terms: $= \{ E[Y_i(1)|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=1] \} + \{ E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=0] \}$
5. Identify the components: $= ATT + \text{Selection Bias}$
   - Where [ATT]{.alert} is the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated
   - And [Selection Bias]{.alert} is $\{ E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=1] - E[Y_i(0)|Z_i=0] \}$, which is the difference in the *potential untreated outcomes* between those who selected treatment and those who did not
6. Under randomisation, $ATT = ATE$, and the [selection bias term averages to zero]{.alert}

- [Balance tests]{.alert} check pre-treatment covariate balance; useful diagnostic, but doesn't guarantee balance on *unobservables*
- Beware common biases like [attrition bias]{.alert}, [survivorship bias]{.alert}, and [post-treatment bias]{.alert} (controlling for mediators)

## Hypothesis testing: Neyman vs Fisher (Lec 05)

:::{style="font-size: 26px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Neyman Approach (ATE)
- Focuses on estimating the average effect in the population
- Tests hypotheses like $H_0: ATE = 0$ vs $H_a: ATE \neq 0$
- Uses test statistics (e.g, $t$-stat = estimate / SE) and $p$-values; rejects $H_0$ if $p$-value < $\alpha$
- Confidence Intervals provide a range of plausible values for the ATE
- Relies on [large sample approximations]{.alert} (Central Limit Theorem)
- Considers Type I ($\alpha$) and Type II ($\beta$) errors; [Power = 1 - $\beta$]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Fisher Approach (Randomisation Inference)
- Uses the random assignment process itself as the basis for inference
- Tests the [sharp null hypothesis]{.alert} ($H_0: Y_i(1) = Y_i(0)$ for *all* $i$)
- Simulates all possible random assignments under $H_0$ to build a reference distribution
- The $p$-value is the proportion of simulated statistics as extreme as the observed one
- Requires fewer assumptions (no normality) and yields exact $p$-values; good for small samples (uses `ri2` package)
:::
:::
:::

## Randomisation inference details (Lec 05 cont)

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The core idea of RI is to ask: "_Assuming the treatment had absolutely no effect on anyone (the sharp null), how likely were we to get a difference-in-means as large as the one we actually observed, just by the random chance of assignment?_"
- We generate the [randomisation distribution]{.alert} by:
  - Assuming $H_0$ is true, so $Y_i(1)=Y_i(0)=Y_i^{obs}$ for all $i$
  - Recalculating the difference-in-means (or other test statistic) for many (or all) possible ways the units could have been randomly assigned to $Z=1$ and $Z=0$ 
  - Plotting these simulated differences
- The $p$-value is the fraction of simulated differences that are as large or larger in magnitude than our actual observed difference
- This avoids assumptions about the distribution of outcomes needed for t-tests

## Key experimental findings (Lec 06)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Discussed influential studies applying experimental methods:
    - [Kalla & Broockman (2015)]{.alert}: Used a field experiment (blocked randomisation) to show revealing donor status significantly increased political access to US congressional officials
    - [Bertrand & Mullainathan (2004)]{.alert}: Employed a correspondence study (field experiment) randomising names on CVs, finding significant callback gaps favouring White-sounding names in the US labour market
    - [Chattopadhyay & Duflo (2004)]{.alert}: Leveraged a natural experiment (randomised council seat reservations in India) showing female leaders prioritised different public goods (water vs roads) compared to male leaders

# Design Challenges & Solutions 🛠️ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Blocking and clustering (Lec 07 & 08)

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Blocking
- [Group units by pre-treatment covariates]{.alert} ($X$) related to outcome ($Y$); randomise *within* blocks
- Increases precision (removes between-block variance), ensures balance on $X$
- Include block fixed effects or use interaction estimators (`lm_lin`)

### Clustering
- [Treatment assigned at group level]{.alert} (village, school); outcomes measured at individual level
- Often necessary due to practical constraints or spillovers
- **Challenge:** [Intra-Cluster Correlation (ICC)]{.alert} violates independence ($\rho = \frac{\sigma^2_{between}}{\sigma^2_{between} + \sigma^2_{within}}$)
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Clustering Consequences & Power
- Use [Cluster-Robust Standard Errors (CRSE)]{.alert} (`estimatr::lm_robust(..., clusters = ...)`), requires sufficient clusters
- Power analysis must account for ICC; driven more by [number of clusters]{.alert}
- Improve designs via [pair-matching or blocking at the cluster level]{.alert}

:::
:::

## Power analysis principles (Lec 08 cont)

:::{style="font-size: 26px;"}
- [Statistical power]{.alert} is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (detecting a true effect)
- Conventionally aim for power $\ge 0.80$
- Power depends on:
    - [Effect size:]{.alert} Larger effects are easier to detect
    - [Sample size ($N$):]{.alert} Larger $N$ increases power
    - [Significance level ($\alpha$):]{.alert} Lower $\alpha$ reduces power
    - [Outcome variance ($\sigma^2$):]{.alert} Lower variance increases power
    - [Proportion treated:]{.alert} Power is maximised with equal group sizes (50/50 split)
    - [Design features:]{.alert} Blocking increases power; clustering decreases power (must use $n_{ESS}$)
- Conduct power analysis *before* the experiment using tools like `DeclareDesign` or power calculators, making reasonable assumptions about effect size and variance
:::

## One-sided non-compliance (Lec 09)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Some assigned to treatment ($Z=1$) don't receive it ($D=0$), but control compliance ($Z=0 \implies D=0$) is perfect
- [Compliers]{.alert} ($D_i(1)=1, D_i(0)=0$) and [Never-takers]{.alert} ($D_i(1)=0, D_i(0)=0$)
- [Intent-to-Treat (ITT)]{.alert} effect ($E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]$) estimates the effect of *assignment*; it's unbiased but diluted
- [Complier Average Causal Effect (CACE/LATE)]{.alert} ($E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | D_i(1)>D_i(0)]$) estimates the effect of treatment *on compliers*
- Estimation uses [Instrumental Variables]{.alert} (IV) / 2SLS, with assignment ($Z$) as instrument for treatment receipt ($D$)
- $CACE = ITT_Y / ITT_D$
- Requires relevance, exclusion, independence assumptions

## Two-sided non-compliance (Lec 10)
 
:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Non-compliance occurs in both arms: some $Z=1$ don't get $D=1$; some $Z=0$ *do* get $D=1$ (e.g., control group finds alternative access)
- Adds potential for [Always-takers]{.alert} ($D_i(1)=1, D_i(0)=1$) and [Defiers]{.alert} ($D_i(1)=0, D_i(0)=1$)
- Observed groups become mixtures of compliance types
- Requires the [Monotonicity Assumption]{.alert} (assume no Defiers) to identify CACE; this implies $D_i(1) \ge D_i(0)$ for all $i$
- Estimation still uses IV/2SLS ($CACE = ITT_Y / ITT_D$)
- Always-takers don't bias the IV estimate under monotonicity

## Attrition: missing outcome data (Lec 11)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
- Attrition involves [missing outcome data post-randomisation]{.alert} (e.g., participants drop out)
- Bias occurs if attrition is [non-random]{.alert} (differential attrition related to treatment or potential outcomes)
- Handling Options:
    - Assume MCAR (unlikely); analyse complete cases (reduces power)
    - Assume MAR / Conditional Ignorability ($MIPO|X$): Missingness depends only on *observed* pre-treatment $X$; use [Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW)]{.alert} to upweight observed units similar to missing ones
    - Assume MNAR: Missingness depends on unobservables; use [Bounds Analysis]{.alert} to estimate range of possible ATEs under worst-case ([Manski bounds]{.alert}) or monotonicity assumptions ([Lee bounds]{.alert})

## Ethics in research design (Lec 12)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
- Ethical conduct is integral to good science
- Core Principles from the Belmont Report:
    - [Respect for Persons:]{.alert} Requires informed consent, autonomy, and protection for vulnerable groups
    - [Beneficence:]{.alert} Involves minimising harm and maximising potential benefits through careful risk-benefit assessment; Equipoise (genuine uncertainty) is key
    - [Justice:]{.alert} Demands fair participant selection and equitable distribution of research burdens/benefits
- Practical implementation involves [Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)]{.alert}, clear consent processes, data protection, and considering staff/community well-being
- [Adaptive designs]{.alert} can enhance ethics by allocating more participants to effective treatments sooner

- DeclareDesign formalises research plans using six key components, specified using `declare_*` functions:
    - [Population:]{.alert} Defines units and their characteristics (`declare_model`)
    - [Potential outcomes:]{.alert} Specifies how outcomes depend on treatments (`declare_model`)
    - [Sampling strategy:]{.alert} How units are selected (`declare_sampling`)
    - [Assignment:]{.alert} How units are assigned to treatment (`declare_assignment`)
    - [Estimand:]{.alert} The target quantity of interest (`declare_inquiry`)
    - [Estimator:]{.alert} The procedure/model used for estimation (`declare_estimator`)
- The `DesignLibrary` package provides pre-built templates for common designs

## Pre-analysis plans (PAPs) in practice (Lec 14)

:::{style="font-size: 26px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- PAPs detail the research plan (hypotheses, design, analysis) *before* data analysis
- Aim to increase transparency, reduce bias ([p-hacking, HARKing]{.alert}), enhance credibility
- Stemmed from reproducibility crisis
- [Main components]{.alert}: Motivation, Hypotheses, Population/Sampling, Intervention, Outcomes/Covariates, Randomisation, Analysis Plan (estimators, SEs, power, missing data, subgroups), Implementation details
- Should distinguish confirmatory (pre-specified) from exploratory analyses
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Pros]{.alert}: Credibility, transparency, limits researcher degrees of freedom
- [Cons]{.alert}: Time-consuming, potentially inflexible (mitigated by allowing pre-specified exploratory analysis or clear justifications for deviations)
- Registries like OSF, AEA, EGAP host PAPs
- SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) offer a potentially more flexible alternative but are less common

## Natural & quasi-experiments (Lec 15)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Used when RCTs aren't feasible/ethical, leveraging "as-if" random assignment
- Natural Experiments rely on assignment outside researcher control (e.g, lotteries); require strong exogeneity arguments
- Quasi-Experiments are a broader category; common designs include:
    - [Regression Discontinuity (RDD)]{.alert}: Exploits sharp cut-off rules (e.g., Mignozzetti et al); assumes continuity of potential outcomes at the cut-off
    - [Difference-in-Differences (DID)]{.alert}: Compares changes over time for treated vs control (e.g., Card & Krueger); assumes [parallel trends]{.alert} in the absence of treatment
- Validity depends heavily on the plausibility of underlying assumptions

## Interference & spillovers (Lec 16)

:::{style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Interference occurs when one unit's treatment affects another's outcome (a [SUTVA violation]{.alert}); common in social/network settings
- Standard ATE estimates become biased
- Requires expanding potential outcomes notation (e.g, $Y_{i}(Z_i, Z_{-i})$)
- Designs to address/estimate interference:
    - [Clustered randomisation:]{.alert} Randomise at a level high enough to contain spillovers
    - [Multi-level designs:]{.alert} Randomise at multiple levels (e.g., household & individual) to separate direct/indirect effects

## Heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) (Lec 18)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
- Effects often vary; ATE is just the average; understanding variability is key
- Challenge: $Var(\tau)$ depends on unidentifiable $Cov(Y(1), Y(0))$
- Exploring HTE:
    - [Treatment-by-Covariate Interactions (CATEs)]{.alert}: Estimate ATE within subgroups based on pre-treatment $X$; use regression interactions ($Y \sim Z * X$); [Caution:]{.alert} Correlational re: HTE source; multiple comparisons risk
    - [Treatment-by-Treatment Interactions (Factorial Designs)]{.alert}: Experimentally manipulate multiple factors ($Z_1, Z_2$); allows causal inference about interactions; requires larger N
- Beware the [multiple comparisons problem]{.alert} when testing many subgroups; use corrections (Bonferroni) or pre-specification

## Mediation analysis (Lec 20)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
- Seeks to understand *how* $Z$ affects $Y$ via mediator $M$ ($Z \to M \to Y$)
- Traditional regression methods are often biased due to $M \leftrightarrow Y$ confounding (omitted variables affecting both $M$ and $Y$)
- Potential outcomes approach reveals fundamental identification problem requiring strong 'sequential ignorability' assumptions ($M$ is 'as-if' random conditional on $Z$ and $X$)
- Randomising $Z$ alone is insufficient or impossible
- Using $Z$ as an IV for $M$ requires the strong [exclusion restriction]{.alert} (no direct $Z \leftrightarrow Y$ path), often violated
:::
:::{.column width="45%"}
- [Implicit Mediation]{.alert} is a robust design-based alternative:
    - Experimentally vary treatment components ($Z$ vs $Z'$)
    - Compare effects of different bundles to infer mechanism importance without measuring $M$

## Survey experiments (Lec 21 & 22)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
### Survey Experiments (Lec 21)
- Random assignment embedded within survey instruments
- Ideal for studying attitudes, preferences, information effects
- Common designs: Question wording/framing, order effects, vignettes
- Trade-offs: High internal validity vs potential external validity/demand effect concerns

### Sensitive Topics (Lec 22)
- Challenge: Social desirability bias
- Goal: Elicit truthful responses while protecting privacy
- Techniques: [List Experiment]{.alert}, [Randomised Response (RRT)]{.alert}, [Endorsement Experiment]{.alert}, [Conjoint Analysis]{.alert}

## Survey experiments: validation & design (Lec 21 cont)

:::{style="font-size: 27px;"}
- Ensuring construct validity (manipulating what you intend):
    - Pilot testing treatments before main study
    - Manipulation checks (post-treatment questions assessing if manipulation worked)
    - Placebo conditions (similar task/info but without key manipulation)
    - Non-equivalent outcomes (outcomes that *shouldn't* be affected)
- Design considerations:
    - Comparability across conditions (length, complexity)
    - Realism of vignettes/stimuli
    - Respondent burden and attention (timers, forced exposure)
    - Device compatibility (mobile vs desktop)

## Sensitive survey techniques details (Lec 22 cont)

:::{style="font-size: 28px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [List Experiment:]{.alert} Compare mean count between T (list + sensitive item) and C (list only); difference estimates prevalence; assumes no design effects/no liars; watch for floor/ceiling effects
- [RRT:]{.alert} Respondent uses random device (coin flip) to determine whether to answer truthfully or give fixed response; known probabilities allow estimation; can be confusing for respondents but often performs well in validation
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Endorsement Experiment:]{.alert} Randomly associate policy/statement with endorsing group; difference in support reveals implicit attitude towards endorser; analysis complex with multiple endorsers
- [Conjoint Analysis:]{.alert} Respondents choose between profiles with multiple randomised attributes; estimates importance of each attribute (including sensitive ones) via trade-offs; powerful but complex design/analysis

## Integration of research findings (Lec 24)

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
- Generalising results ([extrapolation]{.alert}) is challenging; distinguish Sample ATE (SATE) from Population ATE (PATE); PATE estimation adds sampling uncertainty
- The [Bayesian framework]{.alert} formally updates prior beliefs with new evidence, can incorporate beliefs about potential bias (e.g., sampling bias); posterior is precision-weighted average
- [Meta-Analysis]{.alert} pools results from multiple studies
    - Fixed Effects assumes one true effect; weights by precision ($1/SE^2$)
    - Random Effects allows true effect to vary across studies (more realistic); accounts for between-study heterogeneity
    - Beware publication bias and study heterogeneity

## Generalisation & meta-analysis details (Lec 24 cont)

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 20px;"}
- PATE standard error includes sampling variance: $SE(\widehat{PATE}) = \sqrt{ \frac{Var(Y_i(1))}{m} + \frac{Var(Y_i(0))}{N-m} }$
- Bayesian updating combines prior precision ($\rho_{prior}$) and data precision ($\rho_{data}$) for posterior precision ($\rho_{posterior} = \rho_{prior} + \rho_{data}$)
- Posterior mean is precision-weighted average: $\mu_{posterior} = \frac{\rho_{prior} \mu_{prior} + \rho_{data} x_e}{\rho_{posterior}}$
- Incorporating bias ($B \sim N(\beta, \sigma^2_B)$) reduces effective data precision: $\rho_{effective\_data} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2_B + \sigma^2_{xe}}$
- Meta-analysis requires careful study selection (PRISMA), data extraction, and choice between fixed/random effects models; meta-regression explores heterogeneity sources

## Wrapping up

:::{style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Phew, that was a lot of content! 😅
- We've discussed from basic experimental design (MIDA, PO) through implementation challenges (compliance, attrition, ethics, interference) to advanced analysis (HTE, mediation, quasi-methods) and synthesis (meta-analysis)
- Key theme: Understanding assumptions, potential biases, and choosing appropriate experimental designs and methods
- Experiments are amazing 🤩! But they require careful thought and execution
- Thank you for your engagement throughout the course 🙌
- Any questions?

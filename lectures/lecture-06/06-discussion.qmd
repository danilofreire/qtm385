# Hi, there! üëã <br> Tudo bem? üòÑüáßüá∑ {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap üìö {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Last time, we...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Covered adding [covariates]{.alert} with `lm_lin()`, [centring]{.alert}, and sub-group analysis with [interaction terms]{.alert} using `lm_robust`.
- Compared the [Neyman-Rubin model]{.alert} (ATE) with the Fisherian model (sharp null hypothesis)
- Talked about [type I and type II errors]{.alert} 
- Discussed [sampling variability]{.alert}, how it relates to sampling distributions, and how it affects the interpretation of experimental estimates
- Introduced [randomisation inference]{.alert} with the `ri2` package, which uses the `randomizr` package
- Demonstrated RI with two examples, including one about [female council heads]{.alert} and the other about [runoff elections]{.alert}
- [Real Experiment]{.alert}: Analysed a paper using linear regression models as well as Randomisation Inference
:::

## Today, we will...
:::{style="margin-top: 50px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Talk a bit about `R` and the packages we have seen so far
- Discuss the next steps of your pre-analysis plan and the final project
- Discuss three papers

- [But first...]{.alert}, let's talk about your group work
:::

## Group Work ü§ù
### What I have in mind...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Now that you have your groups, I'd like you to start working on your pre-analysis plan
- I'll give you some time to discuss your ideas and start writing your plan
- My plan is that you should slowly think about your final project, one step at a time
- What do you think about having two weeks to write the following:
  - Submit at most 2 paragraphs summarising an experiment that you want to develop in this course. At minimum, your summary should include a research question, why the question is important, and a rough sketch of how you plan to answer the question.
- In three weeks:
  - Write a title and abstract for a paper you imagine writing based on your proposed experiment. Assume that your findings align with your theoretical predictions. Remember to establish why the findings matter for your intended audience.
- In four weeks:
  - Outline your pre-analysis plan. Your outline should include sections on the research question, the experimental design, the data you will collect, and the analysis you will conduct. 
:::

## What I have in mind...

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- In five weeks:
  - Use `Quarto` and `DeclareDesign` to write your report and simulate your experiment
- In six weeks:
  - Revised outline, now including a new section titled "Potential Threats." In this section, diagnose threats and briefly describe potential countermeasures. This new section should discuss false positives, statistical power, demand effects, noncompliance, spillover, and attrition.
- In seven weeks:
  - Revised outline, now included a new section on "Heterogeneous Treatment Effects." In this section, discuss how you might explore heterogeneity in treatment effects. This section should include a discussion of how you might use covariates to explore heterogeneity.
- In eight weeks:
  - I will give you feedback on your outline and provide you with the simulated data for your experiment.
  - You will have two weeks to write your final report.
- Last week of class:
  - You will present your findings to the class.

# R packages üì¶ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## `fabricatr`: Simulating data for experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- `fabricatr` is a very useful package!
- You guys have no idea how much time (and money) it has saved me üòÖ
- It is straightforward to use and has _a bunch_ of functions
- They even have a tutorial showing how to [create common social science data structures](https://declaredesign.org/r/fabricatr/articles/common_social.html)
- So I recommend you to check it out and play around with it üòâ
- The source code is available at <https://github.com/DeclareDesign/fabricatr>

## `randomizr`: Randomisation for experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- `randomizr` is another package that I use a lot
- It is the easiest way to randomise your treatment assignment
- It also has all types of randomisation we use in experiments
  - [Simple randomisation]{.alert} with `simple_ra()`
  - [Complete randomisation]{.alert} with `complete_ra()`
  - [Block randomisation]{.alert} with `block_ra()`
  - [Cluster randomisation]{.alert} with `cluster_ra()`

## `estimatr`: Estimating treatment effects

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- We have already seen `estimatr` in action
- The package is particularly useful to estimate linear models with robust standard errors
  - Economists use OLS for _everything_ üòÖ
- But you can also use it to estimate instrumental variables models, difference-in-differences, and more
- `estimatr` integrates well with the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), so you can use it with `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, and other packages

## Kalla, J. & D. Broockman. 2015 
### [Campaign Contributions Facilitate Access to Congressional Officials: A Randomized Field Experiment](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ajps.12180)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px; text-align: center;"}
![](figures/abstract-kalla.png){width=60%}


[Article link](https://doi.org/10.1111/ajps.12180) and [replication data](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/28582)
:::

## Overview

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Overview]{.alert}
  - Do campaign donations secure preferential treatment from policy makers?
  - Challenge: It is hard to isolate the effect of donations on policymakers' behaviour
  - First randomised field experiment on campaign contributions and access
  - Do donations *facilitate access* to influential policy makers?

- [The Experiment]{.alert}
  - A political organisation tried to schedule meetings between congressional offices and their members (who were donors)
  - The organisation randomly revealed to offices if attendees were donors
  - Key finding: When informed attendees were donors, policymakers were available 3-4 times more often
  - Underscores concerns about campaign finance deregulation
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Why Should We Care?]{.alert}
  - Political Inequality: Campaign donations may amplify the voices of the wealthy
  - Policy Decisions: Understanding who has access informs how policies are made
  - Democracy: This research is crucial for a more equitable political system

- [Policy Relevance]{.alert}
  - Campaign finance reform: Findings can inform debates about the necessity of these reforms
  - Regulation: This study helps to clarify the relationship between campaign donations and access to power
  - Supreme Court decisions: Results bear on recent deregulation (at the time)
:::
:::
:::

## Key Debates

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Key Questions]{.alert}
  - Are campaign contributions a form of speech, or a form of exchange/contract?
  - Does the 'marketplace of ideas' become skewed when one side is better funded?

- [Primary Hypotheses]{.alert}
  - The Core Idea: Revealing that prospective attendees are donors will increase the likelihood of meetings with senior officials.
  - H1: Senior policy makers will make themselves available more often when they know that prospective attendees are political donors.
  - H2: That knowing about donations matters more when scheduling meetings with higher level officials.
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [The Logic]{.alert}
  - Access is a Resource: Policymakers' time is a finite and scarce resource
  - Donors Signal Value: Donations can be perceived as signals of shared interests, expertise, or future support
  - Potential for Reciprocity: Policymakers may see potential gains in meeting with those who have demonstrated political activity
  - Conditional effects: The effect may be stronger when meetings are requested with the most senior staff
  - More senior staff means more important political power
:::
:::
:::

## Intervention

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Intervention]{.alert}
  - A grassroots political organisation attempts to schedule meetings with congressional offices
  - Whether congressional offices are informed that attendees are political donors
  - Control Condition: Offices are informed the meeting attendees are ‚Äúlocal constituents"

- [Outcome Measurement]{.alert}
  - Primary Outcome: The seniority/level of the official who agreed to attend the meeting
  - Rank Order: The access level was ranked from 1 (most desirable: member of Congress) to 6 (least desirable: no meeting)
  - Data Collection:  The level of staff that agreed to the meeting was collected
  - Meeting:  Attendees confirmed that the promised staffer attended the meeting
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Random Assignment]{.alert}
  - Blocking: The researchers blocked congressional offices into triplets based on factors that could be associated with legislative access (prior voting record, cosponsorship of the bill, years of service, ideology, local population)
  - Randomisation: within the blocks, offices were randomly assigned to the 'donor revealed' condition.
  - 191 congressional offices were contacted, 96 in the treatment group and 95 in the control group

:::

## Discussion

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- [Implications]{.alert}
  - The study provides evidence that campaign donations can facilitate access to policymakers
  - The findings underscore concerns about the influence of money in politics
  - The results suggest that campaign finance reform may be necessary to ensure a more equitable political system
- [Limitations]{.alert}
  - Mechanisms: The exact reasons why legislators reacted to donations needs further study
  - Causal Chain: The link between access and influence requires further investigation
  - Generalisability: More studies with different actors, organisations and contexts are required

:::

## Overview

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Overview]{.alert}
  - Research Question: Is there racial bias in callback rates for job interviews?
  - Challenge: Difficult to isolate racial discrimination from other factors
  - Method: A field experiment using fictitious resumes
  - Manipulation: Randomly assigned names to signal race (White vs. African-American)

- [The Experiment]{.alert}
  - Fictitious Resumes: Sent to real job ads in Boston and Chicago
  - Name Manipulation: Resumes randomly assigned White-sounding or African-American-sounding names
  - Callback Rate: Measured the rate at which resumes received interview requests
  - Resume Quality: Varied to test if bias differs by qualification
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Why Should We Care?]{.alert}
  - Racial Inequality: Persistent racial disparities in the labour market
  - Discrimination: Understanding the mechanisms of racial discrimination
  - Policy Implications: Informative for policies aimed at promoting equal opportunity

- [Policy Relevance]{.alert}
  - Affirmative Action:  Assessing the effectiveness of current policies
  - Anti-discrimination Law:  Evidence for the continued relevance of anti-discrimination efforts
  - Social Justice:  Highlighting ongoing challenges to racial equality
:::
:::
:::

## Key Debates

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Key Questions]{.alert}
    - Do employers treat observably similar applicants from different races differently?
    - Is differential treatment due to employer prejudice or statistical discrimination?
    - Are affirmative action programs effective in eliminating racial bias?

- [Primary Hypotheses]{.alert}
  - Core Idea:  Resumes with White-sounding names will receive more callbacks than equivalent resumes with African-American-sounding names
  - H1:  White names will receive a significantly higher callback rate
  - H2:  The racial gap in callback rates will persist even for higher quality resumes

:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [The Logic]{.alert}
  - Employer Bias:  Potential for both conscious and unconscious bias in hiring decisions
  - Statistical Discrimination: Employers may use race as a proxy for unobservable skills or productivity
  - Testing for Pure Discrimination: The randomised design helps isolate the effect of race, independent of qualifications
  - Exploring Nuances: Varying resume quality and analysing by job/employer characteristics helps understand the nature of discrimination
:::
:::
:::

## Intervention

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Experimental Design]{.alert}
    - Field Experiment:  Real-world setting of job applications
    - Correspondence Testing:  Methodology of sending matched resumes with manipulated variables
    - Random Assignment: Names randomly assigned to resumes

- [Intervention: Name Manipulation]{.alert}
    - White Names:  Emily Walsh, Greg Baker (distinctively White-sounding)
    - African-American Names: Lakisha Washington, Jamal Jones (distinctively African-American-sounding)
    - Control:  Implicit control through random assignment ‚Äì each resume acts as its own control when names are varied

- [Outcome Measurement]{.alert}
    - Primary Outcome: Callback for an interview (binary - yes/no)
    - Measurement: Tracked responses to resumes (phone or email)
    - Robustness:  Consistent measurement across conditions
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Creating Resumes]{.alert}
    - Resume Templates:  Based on real resumes from job search websites (Boston & Chicago)
    - Quality Variation:  Created "high-quality" and "low-quality" resumes with subtle differences in experience and skills
    - Matching:  Resumes tailored to fit specific job ad requirements
    - Large Scale:  Over 5000 resumes sent in response to over 1300 job ads

- [Sample and Data Collection]{.alert}
    - Job Ads:  Newspaper ads in Boston Globe and Chicago Tribune (Sales, Admin, Clerical, Customer Service).
    - Cities: Boston and Chicago (conducted in 2001-2002)

## Discussion

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
- [Key Findings]{.alert}
  - Significant Racial Gap: White names receive 50% more callbacks
  - Resume Quality Matters Less for African-Americans:  Improved credentials do not close the racial gap
  - Uniformity of Gap: Bias is consistent across occupations, industries, and employer types
- [Implications]{.alert}
    - Persistent Discrimination:  Racial bias remains a significant factor in the labour market
    - Limited Returns to Human Capital:  Efforts to improve skills may not equally benefit all racial groups in terms of job access
    - Challenges for Policy:  Highlights the complexity of addressing racial inequality, requiring more than just skills-based interventions

- [Limitations]{.alert}
  - Callback as Outcome:  Measures access to interview, not job offers or wages
  - Name as Proxy for Race:  Confounding factors (social class inferences from names) are possible, although tested against
  - Generalisability: Focus on specific job categories and cities (Boston & Chicago)

- [Overview]{.alert}
  - How does women's leadership affect policy decisions?
  - Challenge: It is hard to isolate the effect of representation on policy choices
  - India: A unique experiment with reserved seats for women in local government
  - A quasi-experimental study to investigate this effect

- [The Experiment]{.alert}
  - Randomised:  One-third of Village Council head positions were randomly reserved for women
  - Dataset collected in 265 Village Councils in West Bengal and Rajasthan
  - Comparison: type of public goods in reserved and unreserved Village Councils
  - Key Finding: Reservation affects the types of public goods provided, with leaders investing more in infrastructure relevant to their own genders
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Why Should We Care?]{.alert}
  - Underrepresentation: Women are underrepresented in political positions worldwide
  - Policy Impact: Understanding if women make different policy choices

## Key Debates

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Key Questions]{.alert}
    - Do quotas rapidly enhance women's ability to participate in policymaking?
   - Do women and men have different policy preferences?
    - Does a politician's gender influence policy decisions?

- [Primary Hypotheses]{.alert}
  - Core Idea: The reservation of a council seat affects the types of public goods provided
  - H1:  Leaders will invest more in infrastructure that is directly relevant to the needs of their own genders
  - H2:  The effect of reservation is caused by gender, and not other characteristics of women leaders
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [The Logic]{.alert}
  - Gendered Preferences: Men and women may prioritise different types of public goods
  - Political Identity: the identity of a decision maker can influence policy decisions
  - Representation Matters: Women's representation may lead to different policy outcomes than those chosen by men.
    -  Affirmative action may be a way of counteracting the preference of those in power

## Intervention

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Context]{.alert}
    - India: A constitutional amendment required the reservation of one-third of all positions of village chief (Pradhan) to women
    - Implementation: This was implemented in two states: West Bengal and Rajasthan
    - GPs: Local Village Councils, which have influence on local public goods

- [Intervention]{.alert}
    - Randomisation: GPs were randomly selected to be reserved for women
    - Treatment: Whether the village council was randomly reserved for a women leader
    - Control Condition: The council is open to all candidates
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Outcome Measurement]{.alert}
    - Primary Outcome: The types of public goods provided
    - Focus: Investments in specific goods such as drinking water, roads, and other local infrastructure
    - Secondary Outcome: requests and complaints made by different genders

- [The Process]{.alert}
    - Allocation of GPs for reservation:  This was done based on specific pre-existing lists, and the selection was effectively random.

- [Implications]{.alert}
  - Policy choices are affected by the gender of the decision maker
  - Women leaders invest more in public goods aligned with women's priorities, and vice-versa
  - This effect is causal, and not driven by characteristics of women leaders, but their gender per se
 - [Theoretical Contribution]{.alert}
    - Evidence of the effect of identity on the policy making process
    - Contradicts Downsian models of policy preferences.
    - Shows the importance of design of political institutions in ensuring the representation of different social groups.
- [Limitations]{.alert}
  - The study focuses on local governance in India, and may not generalise to other contexts
  - The model does not consider dynamic effects of the policy.
  - Mechanisms: the exact mechanisms of the decision process is still not fully clear

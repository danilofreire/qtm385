# Why look beyond the ATE? {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The limits of averages

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- To this point, we've focused mainly on estimating the [Average Treatment Effect (ATE)]{.alert}
- Assumption: The treatment effect might be similar across individuals
- [Reality]{.alert}: Interventions rarely affect everyone identically. Effects often vary across individuals, groups, or contexts
- [Practical Value]{.alert}: Policymakers want to know *who* benefits most (or least) from an intervention and *under what conditions*
  - Targeting resources effectively
  - Tailoring programmes
- [Scientific Value]{.alert}: Understanding *why* effects vary helps uncover causal mechanisms
  - What makes an intervention work (or not)?
:::

## Examples of heterogeneity

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 33px;"}
- [School Choice]{.alert}: Policies allowing school choice might benefit children whose parents prioritise academic quality more than those whose parents prioritise proximity
- [Job Training]{.alert}: Programmes might increase earnings for voluntary participants but have no effect on those required to attend for public assistance eligibility
- [Tax Compliance]{.alert}: Efforts to increase compliance might work differently depending on whether taxpayers can easily conceal income
- [Advertising]{.alert}: A campaign targeting teenagers might alienate older consumers
:::

# The fundamental problem of HTE inference {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Defining treatment effect heterogeneity

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Individual treatment effect: $\tau_i = Y_i(1) - Y_i(0)$
- Treatment effect heterogeneity refers to the [variance of individual treatment effects]{.alert} across subjects: $Var(\tau)$
- We want to estimate $Var(\tau)$ and test if $Var(\tau) > 0$ (indicating heterogeneity)
- Recall the relationship:

$$Var(\tau) = Var(Y_i(1) - Y_i(0))$$
$$Var(\tau) = Var(Y_i(1)) + Var(Y_i(0)) - 2Cov(Y_i(1), Y_i(0))$$

- This equation highlights the challenge! Let's see why... 🤓
:::

## Decomposing the variance

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- $Var(Y(1))$ + $Var(Y(0))$: Total variance in outcomes *if we could see both worlds*
- $Cov(Y_i(1), Y_i(0))$: The [covariance term]{.alert}. This is the key!
  - It asks: Do people who would have high outcomes *without* the treatment also have high outcomes *with* it?
- [Why subtract the covariance?]{.alert} It accounts for stable differences between subjects
- [Scenario: high positive covariance]{.alert} (common case)
  - People who are "high-achievers" ($Y_i(0)$ is high) may also be "high-achievers" *after* treatment ($Y_i(1)$ is high)
  - This stable difference makes $Var(Y(1))$ and $Var(Y(0))$ large, but there's no heterogeneity in the *effect*
  - Subtracting $2Cov(\cdot)$ [corrects for this stable variance]{.alert}, isolating the true variance of the effect, $Var(\tau)$
- [Example:]{.alert} If the effect is constant ($\tau_i = \tau$ for all $i$), then $Var(\tau) = 0$. The high covariance between $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ will cancel out the other two terms
:::

## What experimental data tell us (and what they don't)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Experiments give us samples of $Y_i(1)$ (from the treatment group) and $Y_i(0)$ (from the control group)
- From these, we can estimate the [marginal distributions]{.alert} of $Y(1)$ and $Y(0)$
- We can estimate, for instance, $E[Y(1)]$, $E[Y(0)]$, $Var(Y(1))$, and $Var(Y(0))$
- **BUT:** We *never* observe both $Y_i(1)$ and $Y_i(0)$ for the same individual $i$
- Therefore, we [cannot directly estimate the joint distribution]{.alert} of potential outcomes
- So we [cannot estimate $Cov(Y_i(1), Y_i(0))$]{.alert}
- Without the covariance, we [cannot directly calculate $Var(\tau)$]{.alert}!
:::

## Illustrating the problem

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Suppose $N=6$ subjects. We observe outcomes:
  - Control Group ($Y(0)$): ${1, 2, 3}$ -> $\hat{Var}(Y(0))=1$
  - Treatment Group ($Y(1)$): ${4, 5, 6}$ -> $\hat{Var}(Y(1))=1$
- Estimated ATE = $E[Y(1)] - E[Y(0)] = 5 - 2 = 3$
- What is $Var(\tau)$? It depends on how potential outcomes are paired (which we don't know):
- [Scenario 1 (perfect positive correlation):]{.alert} Pairs are ${(1,4), (2,5), (3,6)}$
  - Individual effects $\tau_i$ are ${3, 3, 3}$
  - $Var(\tau) = 0$. [Homogeneous effect]{.alert}
- [Scenario 2 (perfect negative correlation):]{.alert} Pairs are ${(1,6), (2,5), (3,4)}$
  - Individual effects $\tau_i$ are ${5, 3, 1}$
  - $Var(\tau) = Var(\{5,3,1\}) = 4$. [Heterogeneous effect]{.alert}
- [Scenario 3 (Mixed):]{.alert} Pairs are ${(1,6), (2,4), (3,5)}$
  - Individual effects $\tau_i$ are ${5, 2, 2}$
  - $Var(\tau) = Var(\{5,2,2\}) = 3$. [Heterogeneous effect]{.alert}

- Experimental data alone do not distinguish these scenarios!

# Detecting heterogeneity: bounds & tests {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Bounding the variance of treatment effects

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Since we can't estimate $Cov(Y(1), Y(0))$, we can't pinpoint $Var(\tau)$
- However, we can [estimate bounds on $Var(\tau)$]{.alert} by considering the most extreme possible correlations (Heckman, Smith, Clements 1997)
- We can use the same pairing logic from the previous example
- [Procedure (for equal group sizes):]{.alert}
  1. Sort observed $Y(0)$ values ascendingly
  2. Sort observed $Y(1)$ values ascendingly
  3. [Lower Bound for $Var(\tau)$:]{.alert} Pair the sorted values rank-by-rank (1st with 1st, 2nd with 2nd, ...). Calculate the variance of the resulting $\tau_i$ estimates. This assumes [maximum possible positive covariance]{.alert}
  4. [Upper Bound for $Var(\tau)$:]{.alert} Pair the sorted $Y(0)$ values (ascending) with sorted $Y(1)$ values in *descending* order (1st $Y(0)$ with last $Y(1)$, ...). Calculate the variance of the resulting $\tau_i$. This assumes [maximum possible negative covariance]{.alert}
- If the number of subjects differs, pair percentiles instead of ranks
- A lower bound substantially greater than 0 suggests heterogeneity
:::

## Testing for heterogeneity: comparing variances

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- A simpler approach: Test the null hypothesis $H_0: Var(\tau) = 0$ (homogeneous effects)
- If $\tau_i = \tau$ (constant) for all $i$, then $Var(\tau)=0$
- Also, if $\tau$ is constant, $Cov(Y(0), \tau) = Cov(Y(0), \text{constant}) = 0$
- Recall: $Var(Y(1)) = Var(Y(0)) + Var(\tau) + 2Cov(Y(0), \tau)$
- Under $H_0: Var(\tau)=0$, this simplifies to $Var(Y(1)) = Var(Y(0))$
- **Test Idea:** If we observe significantly different variances in the treatment and control groups, we can [reject the null hypothesis of homogeneous effects]{.alert}
- [Caution]{.alert}: Equality of variances does *not* strictly prove homogeneity, but large differences suggest heterogeneity
:::

## Example: teacher incentives variance test

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Revisit the teacher incentives experiment (Muralidharan & Sundararaman 2011)
- Outcome: Change in school test scores (post-pre)
- Observed variances:
  - Control group: $\hat{Var}(Y(0)) = 59.29$
  - Treatment group: $\hat{Var}(Y(1)) = 91.20$
- Observed difference: $|91.20 - 59.29| = 31.91$; is this difference large enough to reject $H_0$?
- **Randomisation Inference:**
  1. Assume constant treatment effect (ATE = 3.50) for all schools (generate full potential outcomes schedule)
  2. Repeat random assignment to treatment/control 100,000 times
  3. For each simulation, calculate the absolute difference in variances between the simulated T/C groups
  4. Find the proportion of simulated differences >= 31.91
- Result: p-value = 0.088
- **Conclusion:** Cannot reject $H_0$ at $\alpha=0.05$, but the borderline p-value [hints at possible heterogeneity]{.alert}. Incentives *might* affect schools differently
:::

## Limitations of basic methods

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Bounds on $Var(\tau)$ are often [very wide]{.alert}, making them uninformative
- Tests comparing $Var(Y(1))$ and $Var(Y(0))$ often [lack statistical power]{.alert}, especially with smaller samples
- These methods don't tell us *why* effects might vary or *who* is affected differently
- They serve as a [preliminary step]{.alert}. Significant results encourage more structured investigation

➡️ Need approaches that examine variation across specific subgroups or conditions
:::

# Treatment-by-Covariate Interactions (CATEs) 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATEs)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- We can partition subjects into subgroups based on [pre-treatment covariates ($X$)]{.alert} and estimate the ATE within each subgroup
- [CATE:]{.alert} Conditional Average Treatment Effect
  - $CATE(X=x) = E[Y_i(1) - Y_i(0) | X_i = x]$
- Example: Estimate the ATE for men vs. women, old vs. young, high income vs. low income
- [Interaction Effect:]{.alert} The difference between CATEs across subgroups
  - $Interaction = CATE(X=x_1) - CATE(X=x_2)$
- This approach uses observable characteristics to explore *potential* sources of heterogeneity
- Often guided by theory about *why* effects might differ
:::

## Example: teacher incentives & parent literacy

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Researchers explored if teacher incentive effects varied by school characteristics (Muralidharan & Sundararaman 2011)
- Covariate: Average parent literacy level (pre-treatment). Partitioned schools into below-median and above-median literacy
- [Estimated CATEs:]{.alert}
  - Low Literacy Schools: CATE = 11.14 - 7.83 = [3.31]{.alert}
  - High Literacy Schools: CATE = 12.26 - 8.57 = [3.69]{.alert}
- [Interaction Effect:]{.alert} 3.69 - 3.31 = 0.38
- [Hypothesis Test:]{.alert} Is this difference statistically significant?
  - Using randomisation inference (or regression F-test), p = 0.88
  - [No significant evidence]{.alert} that the treatment effect differs based on parental literacy levels in the school
:::

## Regression framework for CATEs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Regression provides a flexible way to estimate and test CATEs and interactions
- Let $I_i$ be the treatment indicator (1=Treat, 0=Control)
- Let $P_i$ be the covariate indicator (e.g., 1=High Literacy, 0=Low Literacy)
- [Null Model (Homogeneous Effect):]{.alert}
  $Y_i = \alpha + \beta I_i + \gamma P_i + u_i$
  - Assumes a single ATE ($\beta$)
- [Alternative Model (Interaction):]{.alert}
  $Y_i = \alpha + \beta I_i + \gamma P_i + \delta (I_i \times P_i) + u_i$
  - CATE for Low Literacy ($P_i=0$): $\beta$
  - CATE for High Literacy ($P_i=1$): $\beta + \delta$
  - [Interaction Effect: $\delta$]{.alert}
- Use an F-test to see if the model with the interaction term ($\delta$) fits significantly better than the null model (i.e., test $H_0: \delta = 0$)
- In the teacher incentive example, the F-test yields $p = 0.88$, matching the randomisation inference
:::

# Cautions with CATEs ⚠️ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The multiple comparisons problem

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Datasets often contain many potential covariates (age, gender, income, education, location, etc.)
- If we test for interactions with many covariates, the chance of finding a [significant interaction purely by chance]{.alert} increases
- Example: Test 20 uncorrelated covariates for interaction at $\alpha=0.05$. Assume the true effect is homogeneous
  - $(1 - \alpha)^q$ gives the probability of no false positives across $q$ tests, so $1 - (1 - \alpha)^q$ is the probability of at least one false positive
  - Probability of finding *at least one* significant interaction: $1 - (1 - 0.05)^{20} \approx 0.64$. (High risk of Type I error!)
- [Solution 1: Bonferroni Correction:]{.alert}
  - If conducting $q$ tests, adjust significance level to $\alpha / q$
  - E.g., for 20 tests at $\alpha=0.05$, require $p < 0.05 / 20 = 0.0025$
  - Simple, but can be overly conservative (reduces power)
  - Other similar solutions exist (e.g., [False Discovery Rate control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate), [Holm-Bonferroni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holm%E2%80%93Bonferroni_method), etc.)
- [Solution 2: Pre-specification:]{.alert}
  - Specify the few theoretically motivated interactions you will test *before* looking at the data (e.g., in a Pre-Analysis Plan)
:::

## Correlation vs. causation in subgroups

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Covariates used for subgroup analysis are [observed characteristics, not randomly assigned treatments]{.alert}
- Finding that CATEs differ between, say, high-education and low-education groups means the treatment effect *correlates* with education
- It does [not necessarily]{.alert} mean that *changing* someone's education level would change how they respond to the treatment
- Education might be a marker for other underlying factors (e.g., income, access to information, underlying health) that are the "true" drivers of the heterogeneity
- [Subgroup analysis is essentially observational/descriptive regarding the source of heterogeneity]{.alert}
- It's useful for prediction (who is likely to respond more?) and generating hypotheses, but not for establishing the *causal impact* of the covariate itself on the treatment effect
:::

## Example: interpreting voter turnout interaction

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- [Gerber, Green, Larimer (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S000305540808009X) sent mailers showing recipients' own (and neighbours') past voting records to encourage turnout
- Finding: Mailer effect (ATE) was larger among people who *had* voted in a previous election (2004) compared to those who hadn't
- [Superficial interpretation]{.alert}: Seeing your *past voting* record is more motivating than seeing your *past non-voting* record
- However, [past voting behaviour (the covariate) is not random]{.alert}. People who voted in 2004 are different from those who didn't in many ways (more politically engaged, different demographics, etc.)
- [Follow-up Experiment (Gerber, Green, Larimer 2010)]{.alert}: *Randomly varied* whether the mailer showed a record of voting or a record of abstention
- [Result]{.alert}: Showing a record of *abstention* was significantly *more* motivating!
- The subgroup analysis conflated the type of person with the content of the message. Direct experimental manipulation was needed to isolate the causal effect of the message content
:::

# Treatment-by-Treatment Interactions (Factorial Designs) 🧪 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Beyond covariates: manipulating multiple factors

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- To make causal claims about why treatment effects vary, [we need to experimentally manipulate the hypothesised moderating factors]{.alert}
- This is done using [factorial experimental designs]{.alert}
- An experimental design that includes two or more "factors" (independent variables), where subjects are randomly assigned to a combination of the levels of these factors
- Example: Factor A (Treatment vs. Control), Factor B (Context 1 vs. Context 2)
- Subjects randomly assigned to one of four groups: (Treat, Cxt 1), (Treat, Cxt 2), (Control, Cxt 1), (Control, Cxt 2)
- Allows us to estimate:
  - Main effect of Factor A
  - Main effect of Factor B
  - [Interaction effect:]{.alert} Does the effect of Factor A *depend* on the level of Factor B?
- This provides stronger causal evidence about moderators than treatment-by-covariate analysis
:::

## Examples of factorial designs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- [Gerber & Green (2000) Voter Mobilisation:](https://doi.org/10.2307/2585837) Crossed multiple communication methods (Factor 1: Canvassing Y/N, Factor 2: Phone Call Y/N, Factor 3: Direct Mail Y/N) to see if effects were additive or interactive
- [Olken (2007) Corruption Monitoring:](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/517935) Crossed top-down audits (Factor 1: Audit Y/N) with bottom-up community monitoring (Factor 2: Invitations to meetings Y/N) in Indonesian road projects. Tested if audits were more effective when community was involved
- Rosen (2010) Discrimination: Crossed putative email sender ethnicity (Factor 1: Hispanic/Non-Hispanic name) with email grammar quality (Factor 2: Good/Bad grammar) sent to state legislators. Tested if ethnic discrimination depended on perceived social class (signalled by grammar)
:::

## Rosen (2010) example: ethnicity and grammar

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 21px;"}
- Do U.S. state legislators respond differently to constituent emails based on perceived ethnicity and writing quality?

- 2x2 Factorial Design:
  - Factor 1: Sender Name (Colin Smith vs. José Ramirez)
  - Factor 2: Email Grammar (Good vs. Bad)

- Outcome: Percentage of emails receiving a reply

- Results (Subset, N=100 per cell):

|                     | Colin Smith (Non-Hispanic) | José Ramirez (Hispanic) | Difference (José - Colin) |
| :------------------ | :------------------------: | :---------------------: | :-----------------------: |
| **Good Grammar**    |             52%            |           37%           |          [-15%]{.alert}   |
| **Bad Grammar**     |             29%            |           34%           |          [+5%]{.alert}    |
| **Difference (Bad-Good)** |          [-23%]{.alert}   |          [-3%]{.alert}    |                           |

- [Interpretation:]{.alert}
  - With good grammar, Colin gets more replies (-15% effect for José)
  - With bad grammar, José gets slightly *more* replies (+5% effect)
  - The effect of ethnicity *depends on* grammar quality ([Interaction]{.alert})
  - Poor grammar hurts Colin much more (-23%) than José (-3%)

## Advantages and caveats of factorial designs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- [Advantages:]{.alert}
  - Allows causal estimation of [interaction effects]{.alert}
  - Efficient way to study multiple factors simultaneously
  - Can reveal complex relationships (e.g., conditions where a treatment is effective/ineffective)
- [Caveats:]{.alert}
  - Require larger sample sizes to detect interactions (interactions are often smaller than main effects)
  - Can become complex logistically with many factors/levels
  - [Non-compliance]{.alert} can be problematic: estimating effects for those receiving *multiple* treatments requires sufficient compliers in those specific cells, which can be rare

## Extending the regression framework

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- Regression is a powerful tool for modelling both treatment-by-covariate and treatment-by-treatment interactions. And [you already know how to use it!]{.alert}
- [Systematic Heterogeneity:]{.alert} Variation in $\tau$ that can be predicted by observed covariates or experimental factors (modelled by interaction terms)
- [Idiosyncratic Heterogeneity:]{.alert} Residual variation in $\tau$ not explained by the model (part of the error term $u_i$)
- We use [interaction terms]{.alert} to capture systematic heterogeneity

## Modelling treatment-by-treatment interaction

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Let $J_i = 1$ if sender is José, 0 if Colin
- Let $G_i = 1$ if grammar is bad, 0 if good
- Model: $Y_i = \alpha + \beta J_i + \gamma G_i + \delta (J_i \times G_i) + u_i$
- **Interpreting Coefficients:**
  - $\alpha$: Mean outcome for baseline (Colin, Good Grammar) = 52%
  - $\beta$: Effect of José vs. Colin, *when grammar is good* = 37% - 52% = [-15%]{.alert}
  - $\gamma$: Effect of Bad vs. Good grammar, *when sender is Colin* = 29% - 52% = [-23%]{.alert}
  - $\delta$: Interaction effect. How the effect of José changes when grammar goes from good to bad.
    - Effect of José (Bad Grammar) = ($\alpha + \gamma$) + ($\beta + \delta$)
    - Effect of José (Good Grammar) = $\alpha + \beta$
    - Difference = $\gamma + \delta$
    - Alternatively: $\delta$ = (Effect of Bad Grammar for José) - (Effect of Bad Grammar for Colin) = (-3%) - (-23%) = [+20%]{.alert}
- **Estimates for Rosen data:** $\hat{Y}_i = 0.52 - 0.15 J_i - 0.23 G_i + 0.20 (J_i \times G_i)$
- **Testing the Interaction:** F-test for $H_0: \delta = 0$. In Rosen's data, p = 0.037. [Significant interaction]{.alert}

## Automating the search for interactions

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Manually specifying and testing interactions becomes infeasible with many covariates/factors
- [Machine Learning Approaches:]{.alert} Algorithms designed to automatically search for interactions
  - E.g., [Generalised Random Forests (Athey & Imbens)](https://github.com/grf-labs/grf)
  - Methodically partition the data based on covariates to find subgroups with different treatment effects
  - Often use techniques like cross-validation to avoid overfitting and false discoveries
- Can be a great exploratory tool, especially in high-dimensional settings
- Still requires careful interpretation and follow-up validation
- Beyond the scope of this lecture, but good to be aware of! 🤓

## Appendix 01: why $- 2Cov$?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
The 2 comes from the algebraic expansion of a squared difference. More formally:

Let $X = Y_i(1)$ and $Y = Y_i(0)$. We want $Var(X - Y)$.

1. Start with the definition of Variance:

$Var(Z) = E[ (Z - E[Z])^2 ]$

So, $Var(X - Y) = E[ ( (X - Y) - E[X - Y] )^2 ]$

2. Rearrange the terms inside:

$Var(X - Y) = E[ ( (X - E[X]) - (Y - E[Y]) )^2 ]$

3. Expand the square (like $(a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2$):

Let $a = (X - E[X])$ and $b = (Y - E[Y])$.

$Var(X - Y) = E[ (X-E[X])^2 \mathbf{- 2}(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y]) + (Y-E[Y])^2 ]$

4. Distribute the Expectation ( $E[A - B + C] = E[A] - E[B] + E[C]$ ):

$Var(X-Y) = E[(X-E[X])^2] \mathbf{- 2}E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] + E[(Y-E[Y])^2]$

5. Recognise the definitions of Variance and Covariance:

$E[(X-E[X])^2] = Var(X)$

$E[(Y-E[Y])^2] = Var(Y)$

$E[(X-E[X])(Y-E[Y])] = Cov(X, Y)$

6. Substitute back:

$Var(X - Y) = Var(X) - 2Cov(X, Y) + Var(Y)$

$Var(\tau) = Var(Y_i(1)) + Var(Y_i(0)) - 2Cov(Y_i(1), Y_i(0))$

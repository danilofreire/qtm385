# Today's plan üìÖ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## A closer look at pre-analysis plans
### Writing and executing PAPs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We have briefly discussed the importance of PAPs before
- Today, we will dive a little deeper into the topic
- We will discuss their pros and cons
- We will talk about their components
  - Research questions, hypotheses, variables, estimation, threats to validity
- In your group, you will work on a PAP template and discuss how its components apply to your research project
- Finally, we will see some examples of PAPs you can use as a reference

# The brief history of PAPs üìú {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Why do we bother with PAPs?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The idea of PAPs is actually [more recent than you might think]{.alert}
- While RCTs have been around for decades, the first PAPs were written in the early 2000s in response to a [growing concern about false results in medicine]{.alert}
- In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA) mandated the public registration of clinical trials, [including protocols for data collection and analysis]{.alert}
- This led to [ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov/) in 2000, a registry requiring researchers to outline primary outcomes, sample sizes, and statistical methods before patient enrollment
- As you might expect, these [statistical analysis plans (SAPs)]{.alert} were designed to prevent data mining and selective reporting
- The [International Council for Harmonisation (ICH)](https://www.ich.org/) in Madrid further expanded these requirements to [include handling of missing data and statistical models]{.alert} to reduce [Type I errors]{.alert}

## The rise of PAPs: Ulysses pacts for researchers?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The 2010s were a decade of [reproducibility crises]{.alert} 
- Several studies tried to [replicate famous experiments and failed]{.alert}
- The [Open Science Framework (OSF)](https://osf.io/) was created in 2012 to promote [open science practices]{.alert}
- The [American Economic Association (AEA)](https://www.aeaweb.org/) launched the [RCT Registry](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/) in 2013
- [Casey et al. (2012)](https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qje027) demonstrated how PAPs could "bind researchers‚Äô hands" against data mining by pre-specifying outcomes, covariates, and subgroup analyses
- [Olken (2015)](https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.29.3.61) argued that comprehensive PAPs, like a "Ulysses pact", were necessary to limit researcher discretion
- [Simmons et al. (2011)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611417632) mention the idea of "researchers' degrees of freedom", since ["it is unacceptably easy to publish ‚Äústatistically significant‚Äù evidence consistent with any hypothesis"]{.alert}

## Pros and cons of PAPs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The two main advantages of PAPs are [transparency]{.alert} and [credibility]{.alert}
  - They prevent [p-hacking]{.alert} and [HARKing]{.alert} (hypothesising after results are known)
- [But what about the cons?]{.alert}
- [Ofosu and Posner (2021)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/preanalysis-plans-an-early-stocktaking/94E7FAE76001C45A04E8F5E272C773CE) mention some of the main criticisms:
  - [PAPs are time-consuming]{.alert}: 50% of researchers spend more than 2 weeks writing them, 1/4 spend more than a month
  - [They are inflexible]{.alert} and limit the scope for breakthroughs
  - [PAPs force researchers to run sub-optimal analyses]{.alert} to avoid deviations, thus creating boring and uninformative research
  - [People can steal your work]{.alert} and publish it before you do
  - Finally, some say that [PAPs don't even work]{.alert}, as they require constant policing and this is something academia does not reward

 More than 50 hypotheses specified? Really? How can this prevent data mining?

## Responding to criticisms

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 30px;"}
- [PAPs are time-consuming]{.alert}: True, but the authors mention that 64% of respondents said that writing a PAP was useful
- [They are inflexible]{.alert}: Not necessarily
  - A good approach can be ["to freely undertake exploratory investigations that go beyond the PAP, clearly labeling the results of such investigations in the paper as coming from analyses that were not pre-specified, with an explanation provided for why they were added"]{.alert}
- [PAPs are worthless without policing]{.alert}: About 40% of respondents said the reviewers mentioned the PAP in their reviews
- [People can steal your work]{.alert}: This seems to be of little concern, as only 15% of respondents said they cared about this
:::

## SOPs as a flexible alternative to PAPs?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- [Lin and Green (2016)](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~winston/sop-safety-net.pdf) argue that we should adopt an SOP as much as possible to avoid the pitfalls of PAPs
- SOPs are more flexible in the way that they [only specify what you plan to do if something happens]{.alert}, that is, you don't need to specify all the details of your analysis
- They are more like a "safety net" for your research
- They can save time if you work in a research group, as you can share the same SOP with your colleagues and avoid writing multiple PAPs
- You can see an example here: <https://github.com/acoppock/Green-Lab-SOP>
- While interesting in practice, apparently [SOPs never really took off]{.alert}
- [Ofosu and Posner (2021)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/preanalysis-plans-an-early-stocktaking/94E7FAE76001C45A04E8F5E272C773CE) mention that only 3% of respondents said they used SOPs
- Maybe it's time to revisit this idea?

# Components of a PAP üìù {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What should a PAP contain?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- Scholars do not fully agree about [how long or detailed a PAP should be]{.alert}
- [Uri (2017)](https://datacolada.org/64) argues that PAPs should not contain [anything that is not essential]{.alert} to the analysis
- [McKenzie (2012)](https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/impactevaluations/a-pre-analysis-plan-checklist) has a helpful pre-analysis plan checklist that includes only a few points
- [EGAP (2017)](https://egap.github.io/learningdays-resources/Exercises/design-form.html) proposes a more comprehensive list of components, with 7 sections 
  - This is the one we will use in this class!
- From experience, PAPs can be [as short as 2 pages or as long as 50 pages]{.alert}
  - The average is probably between [10-20 pages]{.alert}
- At the minimum, PAPs should include [4 sections]{.alert}:
  - Unit of analysis, population, and inclusion/exclusion criteria
  - Method (observational, experimental, quasi-experimental)
  - Experimental intervention or explanatory variable
  - Outcomes of interest
- Let's see the EGAP template in more detail

## Group activity
### How would you organise your PAP?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 32px;"}
- Together with your group members, you will work on the EGAP template
- The idea is to discuss how you would organise your PAP and fill out the template
- You don't need to complete all of it, just a brief summary of each section
- You have a few minutes to discuss each section with your group, then we will share our thoughts with the class
- Let's start! üöÄ

## Threats to Validity

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| **Section 3:      |                                                  |
| Intervention**    |                                                  |
+===================+==================================================+
| 19. **Compliance**| i. What does it mean to "take" (comply with)     | 
|                   | the intervention?                                |
|                   | ii. If the intervention is a programme, how much |
|                   | does someone need to attend (showing up once?    |
|                   | finishing the programme?) in order to count as   |
|                   | having attended?                                 |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| 20. **Non-        | i. Is there any concern with non-compliance      |
| Compliance**      | (either taking the intervention if assigned to   |
|                   | control/placebo or failing to take the           |
|                   | intervention if assigned to treatment)?          |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| 21. **Ethics**    | i. Is the control condition no worse than the    |
|                   | status quo, according to the best evidence       |
|                   | available?                                       |
|                   | ii. Are there concerns that participants may be  |
|                   | forced to comply with the intervention?          |
|                   | iii. What are the risks and magnitude of         |
|                   | potentially negative effects of the treatment?   |
|                   | Are such risks concentrated on a particular      |
|                   | subset of your population?                       |

| Outcome**         |                                                  |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| 23.               | i. How will it be measured? (Give the actual text|
| **Measurement**   | of the survey question and response options, if  |
|                   | using a survey measure. Is the outcome           |
|                   | continuous, binary, etc.?)                       |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| 24. **Priors**    | i. What is the expected distribution of the      |
|                   | primary outcome? (This may come from a prior     |
|                   | study on a similar population or you may have to |
|                   | make an educated guess).
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| 25. **Validity    | i. Is there any concern with untruthful          |
| and measurement   | reporting? If so, how will you address it?       |
| error**           |                                                  |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

|                   | iii. Will you collect multiple waves of endline  |
|                   | measurement?                                     |
|                   | iv. If you will collect a baseline or midline,   |
|                   | how will you find the same respondents (minimise |
|                   | attrition?)                                      |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| 27. **Covariates**| i. What covariate data do you need, including for|
|                   | subgroup analysis? How will covariates be        |
|                   | measured?                                        |
|                   | ii. What additional covariates (if any) will you |
|                   | measure?                                         |
|                   | iii. What additional outcomes or covariates will |
|                   | you collect to distinguish between your          |
|                   | explanation and alternatives if your findings are|
|                   | consistent with your hypothesis?                 |
+-------------------+--------------------------------------------------+
| 28. **Ethics**    | i. Will data collection be onerous (time, effort)|
|                   | or painful (physically, emotionally) for any     |
|                   | respondents?                                     |
|                   | ii. Are these costs necessary? Have they been    |
|                   | minimised?                                       |
|                   | iii. Are they outweighed by the potential        |
|                   | benefits of the research to society?             |

|                   | ii. If you have clusters, what is the intra-class|
|                   | correlation (ICC)?                               |
|                   | iii. Is clustering strictly necessary, or could  |

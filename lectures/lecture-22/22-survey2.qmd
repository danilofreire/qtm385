## Survey experiments
### Core components

:::{style="font-size: 26px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Survey experiments]{.alert} combine random assignment with survey methods to study attitudes
- Main applications: [behavioural economics]{.alert}, [psychology]{.alert}, [marketing]{.alert}, [political behaviour]{.alert}, and [public opinion]{.alert}

  - [Presence/absence]{.alert} of stimuli
  - [Dosage levels]{.alert} of treatment intensity
  - [Qualitative variations]{.alert} in treatment content
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Validation methods:
  - [Manipulation checks]{.alert} post-treatment
  - [Placebo treatments]{.alert} for specificity testing
  - [Non-equivalent outcomes]{.alert} for effect containment

## Survey experiments with a twist

:::{style="font-size: 26px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- What to do when [subjects have an incentive to lie?]{.alert}
- [Sensitive topics]{.alert} are often difficult to study
- [Social desirability bias]{.alert} is a common problem in survey research
- We need [special techniques]{.alert} to study these problems
- [List experiments]{.alert}, [randomised response technique]{.alert}, [endorsement experiments]{.alert}, and [conjoint experiments]{.alert} are possible solutions
- Maintains [plausible deniability]{.alert} for respondents
- Software to estimate these models: <http://sensitivequestions.org/>
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [List experiments]{.alert} measure prevalence indirectly through item counts
- [Randomised response]{.alert} techniques use probability models for anonymity
- [Endorsement experiments]{.alert} assess support without direct attribution
- [Conjoint analysis]{.alert} measures preferences through trade-off scenarios
- Sometimes requires careful [probability weighting]{.alert} in analysis

# List experiments üìã {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What is a list experiment?

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The logic of list experiments is simple
- Respondents are presented with [a list of items and asked how many they agree with]{.alert}
  - Just [how many]{.alert} items, not which ones
- The list includes a [sensitive item]{.alert} (e.g., "I have committed a crime") and several non-sensitive items
- The [sensitive item is randomly assigned]{.alert} to a subset of respondents
- The key is to compare the average number of items agreed with between the treatment group (who sees the sensitive item) and the control group (who does not)
- The difference in means provides an estimate of the prevalence of the sensitive item
- This method is also known as the [item count technique]{.alert}

## Some notation 

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Sample of respondents $N$, where $T_i = 1$ if respondent $i$ is in the treatment group and $T_i = 0$ if in the control group
- $J$ is the number of items in the control list, $J + 1$ is the number of items in the treatment list
- $Z_{ij}(t)$ a binary variable denoting respondent $i$'s preference for the $j$th control item for $j = 1, \dots , J$ under the treatment status $t = 0, 1$
- $Y_{i}(0) = \sum_{j=1}^{J} Z_{ij}(0)$ is the potential answer $i$ would give if asked about the control list
- $Y_{i}(1) = \sum_{j=1}^{J+1} Z_{ij}(1)$ is the number of items in the treatment list that respondent $i$ agrees with
- The observed response is $Y_i = Y_i(T_i)$, where $Y_i(0)$ is in the range of $\{0,1, \dots, J\}$ and $Y_i(1)$ is in the range of $\{0,1, \dots J + 1\}$
- Now let's discuss the assumptions...
:::

## Assumptions

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### No design effects

- First, we need to assume that the [addition of the sensitive item does not change the sum of affirmative answers to the control items]{.alert}
- It is [not necessary]{.alert} that respondents answer the control items truthfully, but the average number of affirmative answers must be the same in both groups
- This is the [no design effects]{.alert} assumption
- Formally, for each respondent $i = 1, \dots, N$, we assume:

$$
\sum_{j=1}^{J} Z_{ij}(0) = \sum_{j=1}^{J} Z_{ij}(1)
$$
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### No liars

- Second, we need to assume that the [sensitive item is not a lie]{.alert}
- That is, [all respondents give truthful answers for the sensitive item]{.alert}
- This is a [strong assumption]{.alert}, as you can imagine

$$
Z_{i,J+1}(1) = Z^*_{i,J+1} 
$$

where $Z^*_{i,J+1}$ represents a truthful answer to the sensitive item. The treatment effect is

$$\hat{\tau} = \frac{1}{N_1} \sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i Y_i - \frac{1}{N_0} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (1 - T_i) Y_i,$$

where $N_1 = \sum_{i=1}^{N} T_i$ is the size of the treatment group and $N_0 = N - N_1$ is the size of the control group

## More about list experiments
### Notes about the design

:::{style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- List experiements have several advantages, as they are [easy to implement]{.alert} and [clear to respondents]{.alert}
- But they have some issues as well:
  - [Limited power]{.alert} to detect small effects
  - [Floor effects]{.alert}: If many respondents [disagree with all or most items]{.alert}, it is hard to estimate the prevalence of the sensitive item
  - [Ceiling effects]{.alert}: If someone agrees with all items, [we know for sure they agree with the sensitive item]{.alert}
  - [Sample homogeneity]{.alert}: If the sample is too homogeneous, it may be hard to detect differences
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- But there are some solutions for these problems
- [Use items that contradict each other]{.alert} to reduce ceiling and floor effects
  - Example: ask about [pro-gun]{.alert} and [pro-choice]{.alert} items 
- A [weakly informative Bayesian prior]{.alert} and [covariates]{.alert} can also be used to reduce ceiling and floor effects
- You can also add [direct questions]{.alert} to the experiment and use a [weighted average of the direct question estimate and the list experiment estimate among those who answer ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to the direct question]{.alert} ([Arrow et al. 2015](https://doi.org/10.1093/jssam/smu023))
- You can also include [multiple sensitive items]{.alert} in the list experiment
- The main issue is to [interpret the results]{.alert} correctly, so we usually see [what explains the sensitive item]{.alert} in the list experiment

# Endorsement experiments {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What is an endorsement experiment?

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Endorsement experiments are a type of survey experiment that measure [support for a policy or candidate]{.alert}
- They are a variation of the [vignette experiment]{.alert}, where respondents are presented with a scenario and asked to evaluate it
- Here, the scenario includes an endorsement from a [prominent figure]{.alert} or [group]{.alert}
- These experiments are often used to study [partisan bias]{.alert}, [group identity]{.alert}, or [framing effects]{.alert}
- The main advantage of endorsement experiments is that they can [elicit preferences]{.alert} without directly asking about them
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- While it is easy to estimate them when there [one group is involved]{.alert}, it is more difficult when there are [multiple groups]{.alert}
- It is a little hard to combine the items, but it is possible
- A solution is to use [Bayesian hierarchical models]{.alert}, which is described in this (very technical) paper: [Bullock et al (2011)](https://imai.fas.harvard.edu/research/files/support.pdf)
- We can also use conjoint experiments, as we'll see in a bit!

## Example
### Measuring Support for Militant Groups in Pakistan

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Militant violence in Pakistan is a serious international problem, yet little is known about who supports militant organisations and why
- There is a strong incentives for locals to [falsify information to avoid repercussions]{.alert}
- Also, [asking respondents directly poses safety risks]{.alert} for researchers and participants alike 
- Unlike a direct measure, nonresponse and social desirability biases are minimised since [respondents are reacting to the policy and not directly to the group itself]{.alert} (or so it seems! üòÖ)
- The authors asked respondents about their level of support for polio vaccinations, curriculum reforms, crime regulations, and border disputes
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Control group:

```{verbatim}
The World Health Organization recently announced 
a plan to introduce universal polio vaccination 
across Pakistan. How much do you support
such a plan?
(1) A great deal; (2) A lot; (3) A moderate amount; 
(4) A little; (5) Not at all.
```

- Treatment group:

```{verbatim}
The World Health Organization recently announced 
a plan to introduce universal polio vaccination 
across Pakistan. Pakistani militant groups 
fighting in Kashmir have voiced support for 
this program. How much do you support such a plan?
(1) A great deal; (2) A lot; (3) A moderate amount; 
(4) A little; (5) Not at all.

# Randomised response techniques üé≤ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Randomised response

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- This is a old technique (Werner 1965, Boruch 1971) that is used to [reduce social desirability bias]{.alert}
- The main idea is the following:
  - The respondent roll a die or other randomising device out of view of the enumerator
  - The enumerator does not know the outcome of the randomisation
  - For instance, if 1 shows in the die, the respondent says no
  - If 6 shows, the respondent says yes
  - If any other number shows, the respondent answers truthfully
  - The enumerator sees the answer, but does not know if it is true or random
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The methods works because [the probabilities are known]{.alert} so we can estimate the true proportion of respondents who agree with the sensitive item
- However, the method is [a little confusing to respondents]{.alert} and it is important to either [run the experiment in person]{.alert} or [provide clear instructions]{.alert} if running it online
- Believe it or not, this is [the most effective]{.alert} method to reduce social desirability bias!

# Conjoint analysis {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Conjoint experiments

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Conjoint analysis measures preferences for [multiple attributes]{.alert} of a product, service, or policy
- The method aims to understand how different factors influence decision-making
- It is also used to study [trade-offs]{.alert} between different attributes
- As the other experiments we discussed, conjoint analysis [provides a plausible deniability]{.alert} for respondents
- Why is that? Because [respondents are not asked about their preferences directly]{.alert}
- Instead, they are presented with a series of hypothetical scenarios and asked to choose their preferred option
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The main advantage of conjoint analysis is that it allows researchers to [study complex preferences]{.alert} in a more realistic way
- Another advantage is that the method is very robust, flexible, and adaptable to various research contexts
- It also [increases sample size significantly]{.alert} as respondents are presented with several scenarios
- However, it can be [time-consuming]{.alert} to design and analyse, but that's pretty much the only con üòâ
- Ah, software to implement it is [quite difficult to use as well!]{.alert}
- See [my own experiment](https://github.com/danilofreire/lynching-experiment-brazil) for an example

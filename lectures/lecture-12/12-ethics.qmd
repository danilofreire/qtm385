::::{.column width="50%"}
- [Attrition]{.alert}: Loss of participants before study completion
- Two main types:
  - [Random attrition]{.alert}: Missingness unrelated to treatment/outcome
  - [Non-random/Systematic attrition]{.alert}: Missingness correlates with variables
- Impacts include reduced [statistical power]{.alert}, potential [selection bias]{.alert}, and compromised [generalisability]{.alert}
- [RAND HIE example]{.alert}: Health insurance experiment where higher dropout in cost-sharing plans (25%) vs. free care (8%) potentially biased results
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Analysis methods:
  - [Inverse probability weighting]{.alert} (IPW): Upweights observations similar to missing ones
  - [Extreme bounds analysis]{.alert} (EBA): Evaluates sensitivity by assuming best/worst case scenarios
  - [Lee bounds]{.alert}: Narrows bounds using monotonicity assumption
- [R implementation]{.alert}: `attritevis` package for visualising and analysing attrition patterns

# A brief history of research ethics 📜 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## In the beginning...
### ...there was no ethics!

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Early research often proceeded with [little formal ethical oversight]{.alert}
- Harmful experiments on humans were conducted [without consent or consideration for subject well-being]{.alert}
- The focus was exclusively on [scientific advancement]{.alert}, sometimes at the expense of [human rights]{.alert}
- Examples of unethical research existed throughout history, but the [scale and insensitive nature]{.alert} of some events in the 20th century prompted change

## The Tuskegee Syphilis Study (1932-1972)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The [Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphillis]{.alert} was a clinical study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the U.S. Public Health Service, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Tuskegee Institute
- The goal was to observe the natural progression of untreated syphilis in rural African Americans who thought they were receiving free health care from the US government
- 399 men had syphilis, 201 did not, and [none were informed of their diagnosis or the study's true purpose]{.alert}
- The study was [terminated in 1972]{.alert} after its unethical nature was exposed
- By the end of the study, [28 participants had died of syphilis, 100 were dead of related complications,]{.alert} 40 of their wives had been infected, and 19 of their children were born with congenital syphilis
- In 1997, President Bill Clinton [apologised on behalf of the US government]{.alert} for the study

## The Nuremberg Code (1947) 
### Some principles we still follow today

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The [Nuremberg Code]{.alert} was a set of research ethics principles for human experimentation created as a result of the Nuremberg Trials at the end of World War II
- Why? [Well, I am quite sure you know the reason...]{.alert}
- The code established [10 principles]{.alert} for the conduct of human experiments:
- Voluntary consent
- Beneficence towards participants
- Avoidance of unnecessary suffering
- No experiments without prior animal testing
- Avoidance of unnecessary physical and mental suffering
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- No experiments if death or disabling injury is expected
- Risks should not exceed benefits
- Proper preparation and facilities
- Qualified scientists
- Participants can withdraw at any time
- The experimenter must be prepared to stop the experiment at any time

## The Belmont Report (1979)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- The [Belmont Report]{.alert} was written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research
- The background was the [Tuskegee Syphilis Study]{.alert} and other unethical research
- The report outlines [three fundamental ethical principles]{.alert} for research involving human subjects:
  - Respect for persons
  - Beneficence
  - Justice
- These principles are the basis for the [Common Rule]{.alert}, which governs federally funded research in the US
  - The Common Rule requires [institutional review boards]{.alert} to review research proposals
- The report also introduced the concept of [informed consent]{.alert}

# Ethical considerations in experimental research 🤔 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Ethical research is good research

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Ethical considerations are [strongly linked to the quality of research]{.alert}
- More specifically, ethical practices [reduce attrition]{.alert} and [improve data quality]{.alert}
- How so? 
  - Participants who feel respected are more likely to [provide accurate and complete information]{.alert}
  - Participants deceived about study purpose might [intentionally skew responses]{.alert}
  - Damaged relationships with communities can hinder future research and interventions
  - Example: The Tuskegee Study led to deep mistrust of medical institutions
:::

## Respect for persons
### Autonomy and protection

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Experiments are by definition [interventional]{.alert}, meaning participants are exposed to treatments or conditions
- So individuals have the right to choose [whether or not to participate in research]{.alert}
- This is known as [informed consent]{.alert} and should include information on:
  - Study purpose
  - Procedures
  - Risks and benefits
  - Compensation
  - Confidentiality
  - Right to withdraw
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- Consent can be [written or oral]{.alert}, depending on the study
- Oral consent is common in [phone surveys]{.alert}, [field experiments]{.alert}, or when [written consent is impractical]{.alert} (e.g. due to literacy issues)
- Special considerations for [vulnerable populations]{.alert} (e.g. children, prisoners, individuals in economic hardship)
- What to do in those situations?
  - Use independent [advocates or representatives]{.alert} to assist vulnerable individuals 
  - [Seek the individual's agreement]{.alert} as much as possible 
  - Use [age-appropriate language]{.alert} to obtain assent

## Anonymity and confidentiality

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Anonymity must be used by definition]{.alert} (with all [identifying information of the subjects destroyed]{.alert} after the study), as it provides the greatest protection to those subjects

- [Sometimes anonymity is not possible]{.alert}
  - Example: elite interviews
- But bear in mind that promises of confidentiality from researchers to subjects can be [overridden by court orders]{.alert}

- For example: Boston College and oral history tapes of Northern Ireland's Troubles (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797).

- What would you do in this situation?

# Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) 🏛️ {background-color="#2d4563"}

## What are IRBs?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- [Institutional Review Boards]{.alert} (IRBs) are committees that review research proposals to ensure they meet ethical standards
- IRBs are [required for federally funded research]{.alert} in the US and in many other countries
- They are composed of [scientists, ethicists, and community members]{.alert} who evaluate the risks and benefits of research
- There is a [formal (standard) application]{.alert} for the approval of research with human beings
- [This is not optional]{.alert}. You cannot interact with human research subjects before this is approved
- The board may consider that your research is enabled to continue, but it is the board that decides this (not you)
- You are obliged to [inform the board]{.alert} about "adverse events" of the research
:::

## What do IRBs consider?

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Description of the population of subjects, how they will be recruited, how they will be compensated (if they are), the context of the research and what you will do in it
- Consent form and standard elements necessary to explain the research to the study subjects
- The data collection instrument (survey questionnaire, etc.)
- Statement of the expected benefits and risks, including how the results will be disseminated
- How subjects can ask questions and report any problems to the review committee and/or you in real time
- How you will ensure the confidentiality, anonymity, and security of the data
:::

## Ethical Review Committees Outside the US

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 29px;"}
- In some countries, the ethical review committee is located in a [ministry of technology/science]{.alert} and will be more accustomed to dealing with medical research than with social science research
- Universities and research institutes or organisations often have their own [ethical review committees]{.alert}
- Prepare to [explain your research a little more]{.alert}
- Perhaps you could plan a meeting over coffee to contextualise social science research for a member of a medical review committee
- Knowledge of the [local language]{.alert} and [legislation]{.alert} is very important

## Beneficence: "Do no harm, maximise benefit"

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Two key points: 
  - [Do no harm]{.alert} (non-maleficence) 
  - [Maximise benefits, minimise risks]{.alert} (beneficence)

- [Risk-benefit assessment]{.alert} is important for every study and [it is your responsibility]{.alert} to ensure that the benefits of the research outweigh the risks 
- Consider [Equipoise]{.alert}: Genuine uncertainty about best approach 
- [Knowledge gain]{.alert} is great, but only if research is credible and well-designed
- [Sometimes it is better not to run the experiment at all!]{.alert}

# Adaptive research design 🔄 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Adaptive randomisation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- [Adaptive randomisation]{.alert} is a technique that allows researchers to adjust the allocation of participants to different treatment groups based on interim results
- That is, the [randomisation probabilities]{.alert} can be adjusted during the study, usually to include [more people in the group that is performing better]{.alert}
- No more 50/50 randomisation!
- This procedure is quite popular [in clinical trials]{.alert} and can be used to [maximise the benefits]{.alert} of the research
- But it requires that the [best solution is found quickly]{.alert} and that the [researchers are able to adapt]{.alert} to the new information
:::

## Justice: Fair distribution of burdens and benefits

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Justice in [participant selection]{.alert} is another ethical principle to consider
  - Who is asked to participate? Who is excluded?
- [Who bears risks? Who benefits?]{.alert}
  - Is distribution of risks and benefits equitable?
  - Avoid disproportionate burden on vulnerable
- The concept is quite complex because [the idea of justice is not universal]{.alert}
  - Equality, need, merit, societal contribution
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Randomisation can promote justice]{.alert}, as it ensures:
  - Equal expected inclusion in research
  - Equal expected access to intervention
  - Promotes procedural fairness: everyone has equal chance and there's no favouritism
- [Limitations of randomisation]{.alert}
  - Doesn't address broader societal inequalities: [should everyone have equal chance?]{.alert}
  - May not be "just" if some populations are over-researched (India, Kenya, etc)
:::
:::
:::

## Implementing justice in practice

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Inclusive research]{.alert}
  - Target populations experiencing the problem
  - Focus on those who benefit from knowledge
  - Avoid convenience samples of less relevant groups
  - Example: Health disparities in minority groups
- [Avoid exclusion]{.alert} for convenience
  - Resist excluding groups due to logistics/cost
  - Exclusion biases data, perpetuates inequities
  - Example: Accommodating participants without internet
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Consider Heterogeneous Effects]{.alert}
  - Power study to detect subgroup impacts
  - Understand equity implications
- [Carefully Justify Sampling]{.alert}
  - Ethical reasons for oversampling subgroups
  - Oversampling for convenience is unethical
  - Provide ethical rationale, IRB review

# Research staff ethics 🧑‍🔬 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Ethical considerations for research staff

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Belmont principles focus on [participants, not staff]{.alert}
- Research staff also face [ethical risks and burdens]{.alert}
- Ignoring staff well-being is [unethical and harms research]{.alert}
- [Physical sisks]{.alert}: Violence, accidents, health hazards
  - Example: Enumerators in high-crime areas
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Psychological sisks]{.alert}: Emotional burden, secondary trauma
  - From sensitive topics (trauma, poverty)
  - Example: Surveyors interviewing abuse survivors
- [Staff well-being is crucial]{.alert}
  - For ethical research and data quality
  - Burnt-out staff make more errors, leave projects

  - De-escalation techniques, emergency procedures
  - Example: Responding to aggressive respondents
- [Debriefing and support]{.alert}
  - Regular sessions for processing emotional burden
  - Counseling access for secondary trauma/burnout
  - Supportive team environment
  - Example: Weekly team meetings for surveyors
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Clear communication]{.alert}
  - Explain study rationale, protocols to staff
  - Address moral dilemmas, staff concerns
  - Equip staff to explain study to participants
  - Example: Workshops explaining randomization ethics

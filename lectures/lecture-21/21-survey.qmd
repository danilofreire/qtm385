## Mediation analysis
### Core components

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Mediation analysis]{.alert} is a statistical technique to understand the mechanism through which an independent variable affects a dependent variable
- It identifies [intermediate variables (mediators)]{.alert} that lie on the causal pathway between the intervention and the outcome
- Divides total effect: direct (intervention ‚Üí outcome) and indirect (via mediator)
- Mediation analysis is based on the counterfactual framework and [requires strong assumptions]{.alert} to identify causal effects
- An important set of assumptions is [sequential ignorability]{.alert}: The mediator is not affected by the treatment after controlling for confounders
  - This is a strong assumption that is often violated in practice
  - When this assumption is violated, the direct and indirect effects are not identified
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
-  Mediation analysis can be [extended to include multiple mediators]{.alert}, either acting in parallel (independent pathways) or in sequence (a chain of mediators)
   - [Even stronger assumptions]{.alert}!
- Longitudinal RCTs allow for the examination of [time-varying mediators and outcomes]{.alert}
- Even in well-conducted RCTs, [mediation analysis is still observational with respect to the mediator]{.alert}
- [Sensitivity analysis]{.alert} can be used to assess the robustness of the results to violations of the assumptions

## Questions

:::{style="font-size: 15px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Question 02

- Estimate $E[Y_{01} - Y_{00}]$ for the random assignment that places the treatment at location A
- Village A is treated. So we have this (from the table): 
  - $Y_{01}^{(A)} = 0$ and $Pr(treat) = 0.2$
- Treated part of the equation: $$ \frac{0 / 0.2}{1 / 0.2} = \frac{0}{5} = 0 $$
- Villages C, D, and F are untreated and not next to A ($Y_{00}$. So:
  - $Y_{00}^{(C)} = 0, \quad Pr(control) = 0.4$
  - $Y_{00}^{(D)} = 6, \quad Pr(control) = 0.6$ 
  - $Y_{00}^{(F)} = 6, \quad Pr(control) = 0.8$
$$
\frac{0/0.4 + 6/0.6 + 6/0.8}{1/0.4 + 1/0.6 + 1/0.8} = \frac{0 + 10 + 7.5}{2.5 + 1.667 + 1.25} = \frac{17.5}{5.417} \approx 3.23
$$

- And the result is:

$$
\hat{E}[Y_{01} - Y_{00}] = 0 - 3.23 = -3.23
$$
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Question 03

- Estimate $E[Y_{10} - Y_{00}]$ for the random assignment that places the treatment at location A, restricting the sample to the set of villages that have a non-zero probability of expressing both of these potential outcomes.
- Village B is the only with spillovers ($Y_{10}$)
  - $Y_{10}^{(B)} = 2$, $Pr(spillover) = 0.4$
  - $\frac{2/0.4}{1/0.4} = \frac{5}{2.5} = 2.0$
- Villages C and D are neither treated nor next to A ($Y_{00}$) 
  - $Y_{00}^{(C)} = 0$, $Pr(control) = 0.4$  
  - $Y_{00}^{(D)} = 6$, $Pr(control) = 0.6$

- Thus, for the control part of the equation:
$$
\frac{0/0.4 + 6/0.6}{1/0.4 + 1/0.6} = \frac{0 + 10}{2.5 + 1.667} = \frac{10}{4.167} \approx 2.4
$$

- Final result: 

$$
\hat{E}[Y_{10} - Y_{00}] = 2.0 - 2.4 = -0.40
$$

:::{style="font-size: 17px; margin-top: 30px;"}
### Question 04

- Estimate $E[Y_{01} - Y_{00}]$ restricting the sample to the same set of villages as in question 3.
- Village F cannot express $Y_{01}$ because we're limiting the analysis to villages as in question 3.
- Village A: 
  - $Y_{01}^{(A)} = 0$, $Pr(treat) = 0.2$ 
  - $\frac{0/0.2}{1/0.2} = \frac{0}{5} = 0$

- Villages C and D (controls): 
  - $Y_{00}^{(C)} = 0$, $Pr(control) = 0.4$  
  - $Y_{00}^{(D)} = 6$, $Pr(control) = 0.6$

- Control part of the equation:

$$
\frac{0/0.4 + 6/0.6}{1/0.4 + 1/0.6} = \frac{0 + 10}{2.5 + 1.667} = \frac{10}{4.167} \approx 2.4
$$

- Result:

$$
\hat{E}[Y_{01} - Y_{00}] = 0 - 2.4 = -2.4
$$

# Survey experiments üìä {background-color="#2d4563"}

## The first survey experiment?

:::{style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
Hadley Cantril (1940) asks 3000 Americans either:
:::

<br>

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Do you think the US should do more than it is now doing to help England and France?

## What are survey experiments?

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- A survey experiment is a research design that combines the [random assignment]{.alert} of treatments with [survey data]{.alert}
- It is particularly used to understand [attitudes, preferences, and behaviours]{.alert}
- Survey experiments are [popular]{.alert} because they are easy to implement and analyse, and they can be used to test causal relationships in a controlled environment
- They can be [implemented in many ways:]{.alert}
  - Face-to-face
  - Telephone
  - Online
  - Mail, etc
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- What stimulus each group receives depends on [hypotheses being tested]{.alert}
- Three ways hypotheses lead to stimuli:
  - [Presence/absence]{.alert}: Does the stimulus have an effect?
  - [Levels/dose]{.alert}: Does the amount of stimulus matter?
  - [Qualitative variations]{.alert}: Does the type of stimulus matter?
- Survey experiments can be [between-subjects]{.alert} or [within-subjects]{.alert}
- They can also be used to measure [sensitive topics]{.alert}, which is something we will discuss in the future

  - Treatment group watches a video containing a negative ad describing a party
- [Outcome:]{.alert} Support for the party described negatively

## How do we know we manipulated what we think we manipulated?

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Outcomes affected are consistent with theory
- Before the study, using [pilot testing]{.alert} (or pre-testing)
- During the study, using [manipulation checks]{.alert}
- During the study, using [placebos]{.alert}
- During the study, using [non-equivalent outcomes]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Outcomes affected:]{.alert}
  - True, but doesn't tell us anything if we hypothesise null effects

- [Pilot testing:]{.alert}
  - Goal: establish construct validity of manipulation 
  - Assess whether a set of possible manipulations affect a measure of the independent variable
- [Example:]{.alert}
  - Goal: Manipulate the ‚Äústrength‚Äù of an argument 
  - Write several arguments 
  - Ask pilot test respondents to report how strong each one was
:::
:::
:::

## Manipulation checks

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Manipulation checks]{.alert} are items [added post-treatment, post-outcome]{.alert} that assess whether the [independent variable was affected by treatment]{.alert}
- We typically talk about manipulations as directly setting the value of $X$, but in practice we are typically manipulating something that we think [strongly modifies $X$]{.alert}
- Example: information manipulations aim to [modify knowledge or beliefs]{.alert}, but are necessarily [imperfect]{.alert} at doing so
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Example:]{.alert} 
  - Treatment 1: Supply Information 
  - Manipulation check 1: measure beliefs 
  - Treatment 2: Prime a set of considerations 
  - Outcome: Measure opinion 
  - Manipulation check 2: measure dimension salience
- Manipulation checks should be innocuous: [not affect the treatment or outcome]{.alert}
- Measure both what you wanted to manipulate [and what you didn‚Äôt want to manipulate]{.alert}
:::
:::
:::

## Placebos and non-equivalent outcomes

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Placebos

- Include an experimental condition that [does not manipulate the variable of interest]{.alert} (but might affect the outcome)
- Example: 
  - Study whether risk-related arguments about climate change increase support for a climate change policy 
  - Placebo condition: control article with risk-related arguments about non-environmental issue (eg., terrorism)
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Non-equivalent outcomes

- Measures an outcome that [should not be affected by independent variable]{.alert} 
- Example: 
  - Assess effect of some treatment on attitudes toward group A 
  - Focal outcome: attitudes toward group A 
  - Non-equivalent outcome: attitudes toward group B

# Common paradigms and examples {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Question wording designs

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}

- Simplest paradigm for [presence/absence or qualitative variation]{.alert}
- Manipulation operationalises this by asking two different questions
- [Outcome is the answer to the question]{.alert}
- Example: [Schuldt et al. ‚Äú‚ÄòGlobal Warming‚Äô or ‚ÄòClimate Change‚Äô? Whether the Planet is Warming Depends on Question Wording.](https://academic.oup.com/poq/article-abstract/75/1/115/1846776?login=false)

You may have heard about the idea that the world‚Äôs temperature may have been [going up]{.alert} over the past 100 years, a phenomenon sometimes called [global warming]{.alert}. What is your personal opinion regarding whether or not this has been happening?

### Instructions

In the next part of this study, you will be asked 14 questions about politics, public policy, and economics. Many people don‚Äôt know the answers to these questions, but it is helpful for us if you answer, even if you‚Äôre not sure what the correct answer is. We encourage you to take a guess on every question. At the end of this study, you will see a summary of how many questions you answered correctly.

- How likely is it that she will have more children in order to get a bigger welfare check?  (1 = Very likely, . . . , 7 = Not at all likely)
- How likely do you think it is that she will really try hard to find a job in the next year? (1 = Very likely, . . . , 7 = Not at all likely)

Imagine that you were living in a village in another district in Uttar Pradesh and that you were voting for candidates in [(village/state/national)]{.alert} election. Here are the two candidates who are running against each other: The first candidate is named [(caste name)]{.alert} and is running as the [(BJP/SP/BSP)]{.alert} party candidate.  [(Corrupt/criminality allegation)]{.alert}. His opponent is named [(caste name)]{.alert} and is running as the [(BJP/SP/BSP)]{.alert} party candidate.  [(Opposite corrupt/criminality allegation)]{.alert}. From this information, please indicate which candidate you would vote for in the [(village/state/national)]{.alert} election.

## Some vignette considerations

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- [Comparability across conditions and groups]{.alert}
  - Length
  - Readability
  - Lexical complexity
- [Realism]{.alert}
- Length 
  - Timers 
  - Forced exposure 
  - Mouse trackers
- Devices 
  - Browser-specificity 
  - Device sizes (e.g., mobile)

## Non-textual stimuli

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="30%"}
- [Images can also work well]{.alert}
- Subliminal primes possible, depending on software
- Lots of recent examples of facial manipulation
- Example:

## Audio, video, and tasks

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
### Audio and video
- [Problematic]{.alert} for same reasons as long texts 
- Best practices: 
  - Keep it short 
  - Have the video play automatically 
  - Disallow survey progression 
  - Control and validate
- Examples:
  - Television Advertisements
  - News Programs
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
### Tasks

- Task designs ask respondents to [perform a task]{.alert} 
- Often developed for [laboratory settings]{.alert} 
- Most common example: writing something 
- Can be problematic: 
  - Time-intensive 
  - Invites drop-off 
  - Compliance problems

## Example

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
These days, Democrats and Republicans differ from one another considerably. The two groups seem to be growing further and further apart, not only in terms of their opinions but also their lifestyles.  Earlier in the survey, you said you tend to identify as a [Democrat/ Republican]{.alert}. Please take a few minutes to think about what you like about [Democrats/Republicans]{.alert} compared to the [Republicans/ Democrats]{.alert}. Think of 2 to 3 things you especially like best about [your party]{.alert}. Then think of 2 to 3 things you especially dislike about the [other party]{.alert}.  Now please write those thoughts in the space below.

## Concluding remarks

:::{style="font-size: 27px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- [Survey experiments are great!]{.alert}
- They are easy to implement and analyse, and there are an [almost infinite number of ways to design them]{.alert}
- However, they require [careful design and implementation]{.alert} to ensure that the manipulation is successful and that the results are valid
- Even [small changes in wording or framing]{.alert} can have large effects on the results
- [Pilot testing]{.alert} and [manipulation checks]{.alert} are important
- [Vignettes]{.alert} are a common and effective way to implement survey experiments
- [Non-textual stimuli]{.alert} can also be effective, but require careful design

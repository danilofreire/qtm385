# Let's get started! 🚀 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Potential outcomes revisited

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Remember from last time: we have two potential outcomes for each unit
- [We only observe one of them]{.alert}: $Y_i = Y_{1,i} \cdot D_i + Y_{0,i} \cdot (1 - D_i)$
  - $D_i$ is the treatment indicator = 1 if treated, 0 if not
- So we need to estimate the [average treatment effect (ATE)]{.alert}:
  - $E[Y_{1,i} - Y_{0,i}] = E[Y_{1,i}] - E[Y_{0,i}]$
- The problem is, [not all comparisons are valid]{.alert}
- I mean, they can be, but only under the [heroic assumption]{.alert} that the groups are similar on average before any adjustment
- Otherwise, we will have [selection bias]{.alert}
- Let's see how this works in practice! 🤓
:::

## Khuzdar and Maria

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Selection bias]{.alert} occurs when the groups are systematically different before treatment
- Using an example from [Angrist and Pischke (2021)](https://www.masteringmetrics.com/), let's say we have a student called [Khuzdar]{.alert} from Kazakhstan, who is considering studying in the U.S. and is worried about the cold weather
- Should he get health insurance? 🤔
- Let's imagine that, without insurance, Khuzdar has a potential outcome of $Y_{0,i} = 3$ and, with insurance, $Y_{1,i} = 4$. So the treatment effect is $\tau_i = 1$, that is, he gains 1 "health point" by getting insurance
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- Now, let's imagine that Khuzdar has a Chilean colleague called [Maria Moreno]{.alert}, who is also considering studying in the U.S.
- But since she comes from chilly Santiago, she is not worried about the cold weather
- So, without insurance, Maria has a potential outcome of $Y_{0,i} = 5$ and, with insurance, $Y_{1,i} = 5$. So the treatment effect is $\tau_i = 0$, that is, she gains no "health points" by getting insurance

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/khuzdar-maria.png){width=80%}
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Khuzdar and Maria

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- In fact, the comparison between frail Khuzdar and hearty Maria tells us little about the causal effects of their choices!
- Why is that? Because [they were different to begin with]{.alert}
- Imagine that Khuzdar got insurance and Maria did not
- Let's do our mathematical trick again: we will add and subtract $Y_{0, Khuzdar}$ from the treatment effect (they cancel each other out, right?)
- So we have the following:

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/selection-bias-math.png){width=80%}
:::

- What would be the result of this comparison? And what conclusion would we draw from it?
:::

## Difference in means = average treatment effect + selection bias

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- So far, so good? 🤓
- If we assume that [the treatment has a constant effect]{.alert} (i.e., the treatment effect is the same for everyone), we can rewrite the equation as:

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/selection-bias3.png){width=17%}
:::

- Where $\kappa$ is both the individual and average causal effect of insurance on health. This is a [simplifying assumption]{.alert} for this derivation; the core result holds even with varied effects
- Using the constant-effects model to substitute for $Avg_n[Y_{1i}|D_i = 1]$, we have

:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/selection-bias4.png){width=50%}
:::
:::

## How to check for selection bias?
### Balance tests

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
- We use [balance tests]{.alert} or ([randomisation checks]{.alert}) to check if the groups are similar before treatment
- The idea is to compare the means of the covariates for the treated and untreated groups
- If the means are similar, it provides evidence that nothing systematic is driving the treatment effect
- We are never 100% sure, but [we trust the random assignment]{.alert}
- Small differences in means are acceptable, as long as they are not systematic
- Why? Because some variation can happen only by chance
- [100% personal opinion]{.alert}: I think they aren't always useful... (can you guess why? 🤔)
- [Mutz et al. (2018)](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1322143) make a good case for that

# Different types of selection bias 🎯 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Causal diagrams and associations

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Causal diagrams]{.alert} are a great way to visualise the relationships between variables
  - They are also called [directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)]{.alert}
  - They are "directed" because they show the direction of the relationships, and "acyclic" because they do not have loops (one cause cannot cause itself)
- They were introduced by [Judea Pearl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judea_Pearl) and are widely used in [causal inference]{.alert} (quick guide [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895435621002407))
- They help us understand the [associations]{.alert} between variables and identify potential sources of bias
- And they are super easy to draw! 🤓
- For instance, let's illustrate a classic example of selection bias with a causal diagram (borrowed from [Hernán et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1097/01.ede.0000135174.63482.43))
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/causal-diagram.png){width=80%}
:::

:::{style="text-align: left;"}
- Figure 1 shows that the common cause $L$ (smoking) results in $E$ (carrying matches) and $D$ (lung cancer) being associated
- Figure 2 shows how [randomisation breaks the association between $L$ and $D$]{.alert}, so the treatment effect is unbiased
- In this case, if you know what $L$ is, you can also [control for it]{.alert} in your analysis

## Some sources of selection bias
### Losses to follow-up: The scenario

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- A common problem in experiments is individuals [dropping out]{.alert} before the study ends
- This is an issue because the [treatment effect may be different for those who leave]{.alert}
- [Example]{.alert}: A study on antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected patients. Let's define the variables:
  - **E (Exposure):** The antiretroviral therapy
  - **D (Disease):** The outcome, developing AIDS
  - **L (Measured):** Presence of other HIV symptoms (e.g., fever)
  - **U (Unmeasured):** True level of immunosuppression
  - **C (Censoring):** The patient drops out of the study ($C=1$)
- Patients with greater immunosuppression (**U**) are more likely to have symptoms (**L**) and are also more likely to drop out (**C**)
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/selective-survival.png){width=80%}
:::

:::{style="text-align: left;"}
- The [causal diagram]{.alert} shows the relationships between these variables
- The core problem is that dropping out (**C**) is related to both health factors and the final outcome
:::
:::
:::
:::

## Some sources of selection bias
### Losses to follow-up: Bias and a solution

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Understanding the Bias:]{.alert}
  - In the diagram, both **L** (symptoms) and **U** (immunosuppression) cause patients to drop out (**C**). A variable that has two arrows pointing into it is called a [collider]{.alert}
  - When we analyse only the people who complete the study, we are "conditioning on the collider"
  - This action distorts the estimated relationship between the therapy (**E**) and the outcome (**D**), leading to [selection bias]{.alert}
- [How can we correct for this?]{.alert}
  - One way is to use [stratified analysis]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- [Stratification is quite simple:]{.alert}
  - **1. Divide:** Assuming **L** is measured, we split participants into groups (strata) based on their symptoms (e.g., mild, moderate, severe)
  - **2. Estimate:** We calculate the treatment effect separately *within each stratum*
  - **3. Average:** We then average the stratum-specific estimates to get the overall treatment effect
- By doing this, we control for the effect of **L**
- [Important caveat]{.alert}: This method only corrects for bias from *measured* variables like **L**. It cannot fix bias from *unmeasured* variables like **U**
:::
:::
:::

## Attrition bias
### Closely related to losses to follow-up

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- [Attrition bias]{.alert} is a type of selection bias that occurs when individuals drop out of a study in a way that is related to the treatment or outcome
- It is [more systematic]{.alert} than losses to follow-up, which can happen by chance (e.g., disengagement, relocation, or other factors, leading to incomplete data)
- For example, in a clinical trial, if participants experiencing side effects disproportionately drop out of the treatment group compared to the placebo group, this difference introduces attrition bias
- In short, attrition bias specifically addresses the bias that arises when these [departures are non-random]{.alert}
- As with losses to follow-up, this is a type of selection bias [that can be caused by the experiment itself]{.alert}, not only by pre-existing differences between groups
:::

## Survivorship bias

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- In my view, one of the coolest examples of selection bias
- [Survivorship bias]{.alert} is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not
- It is also [closely related to attrition and loss to follow-up bias]{.alert} (more commonly mentioned in observational data)
  - Attrition bias emphasises [the process of losing data]{.alert}, while survivorship bias highlights [the exclusion of failures in analysis]{.alert}
- For instance, imagine that you are studying the [effect of education on income]{.alert}
- If you only look at people who have completed college, you are ignoring those who dropped out
- This can lead to an [overestimation]{.alert} of the effect of education on income
- Why? Because those who dropped out may have done so because they were not good students, which can affect their income
- Have a look at this example (you may have seen it before!)
:::
## Survivorship bias in World War II aircraft
:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- During World War II, the US military wanted to [improve the armour on its aircraft]{.alert}
- They analysed the [bullet holes]{.alert} on returning aircraft and decided to add more armour to the areas with the most bullet holes
- Considering the picture you see here, where would you add the armour?
- More [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias#Military)
- Another example: Imagine you are studying mutual fund performance, and you look at funds that are still in operation. You see that they beat the S&P 500 by 2% per year
- What's the problem here?

## Post-treatment bias (or overcontrol)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Post-treatment bias]{.alert} occurs when we control for a variable that is a *consequence* of the treatment
- This is a critical mistake because you are [controlling away one of the causal pathways]{.alert} through which the treatment works

- **Example**: A job training programme
  - **Treatment (T):** The training programme
  - **Outcome (Y):** Finding employment
  - **Mediator (M):** Number of job applications submitted

- The training **(T)** works in two ways:
  1.  **Directly:** It improves skills (T → Y)
  2.  **Indirectly:** It motivates people to submit more applications **(M)**, which in turn leads to employment (T → M → Y)
- [The number of applications is a post-treatment variable]{.alert} because it is caused by the training
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
:::{style="text-align: center;"}
![](figures/post-treatment-bias.png){width="80%"}

Source: [Elwert and Winship (2014)](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043455)
:::

:::{style="text-align: left;"}
- If we add the number of job applications **(M)** to our regression model, we are asking:
  - *"What is the effect of training, holding the number of applications constant?"*
- This blocks the indirect causal path. We are left with an [underestimate of the programme's total effect]{.alert}
- Is there a statistical fix? [Not really!]{.alert}
- The solution is theoretical: [think carefully about your causal model and do not control for mediators]{.alert} when you want to estimate the total effect
:::

## Examples of post-treatment bias

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
### Avoidable post-treatment bias

- Causal effect of party ID on the vote 
  - Do control for race 
  - Do not control for voting intentions five minutes before voting
- Causal effect of race on salary in a firm 
  - Do control for qualifications 
  - Don’t control for position in the firm
- Causal effect of medicine on health 
  - Do control for health prior to the treatment decision 
  - Do not control for side effects or other medicines taken later
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
### Unavoidable post-treatment bias

- Causal effect of democratisation on civil war; do we control for GDP?  
  - Yes, since GDP → democratisation we must control to avoid omitted variable bias
  - No, since democratisation → GDP, we would have post-treatment bias

- Causal effect of legislative effectiveness on state failure; do we control for trade openness?
  - Yes, since trade openness → legislative effectiveness, we must control to avoid omitted variable bias 
  - No, since legislative effectiveness → trade openness, we would have post-treatment bias

## Now it's your turn! 🤓

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- I will list some factors and you tell me if they are likely to be sources of selection bias (and why)
  - Telephone random sampling
  - Ascertainment: when the investigator responsible for assessing the outcome of interest is also aware of the group assignment
  - [WEIRD samples](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/05/weird): Western, Educated, Industrialised, Rich, and Democratic
  - Referral filter: when the study population is recruited through referrals, often from health care providers or NGOs
  - When you ask socially sensitive questions in a survey

# Measuring variability 📏 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Measuring variability (part 1): Standard deviation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Apart from averages, we are also interested in [variability]{.alert}: how spread out is our data?
- The foundational measure is [variance]{.alert}, the average squared deviation from the mean
- The sample variance of $Y_i$ in a sample of size $n$ is defined as:
  - $S(Y_i)^2 = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2$
- Since variance is in squared units, we use its square root, the [standard deviation (SD)]{.alert}
- The SD is a [descriptive]{.alert} measure: it summarises the variability *within* your dataset
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- [Example]{.alert}: Suppose you measure the IQ of 50 students
  - You find the average IQ is $\bar{IQ} = 100$
  - You calculate the $SD = 15$

- [What does this mean?]{.alert}
  - It describes the spread of IQs *in your sample*
  - ["A typical student in your sample has an IQ that is about 15 points away from the sample average of 100"]{.alert}
  - It answers the question: "How much do the individual data points differ from each other?"
:::
:::
:::

## Measuring variability (part 2): Standard error

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- The [standard error (SE)]{.alert} is different: it is the standard deviation of a statistic (like the sample mean)
- It measures [how precise your sample mean is as an estimate of the true population mean]{.alert}
- The standard error of the sample mean is:
  - $SE(\bar{Y}) = \frac{\sigma(Y_i)}{\sqrt{n}}$
- Since we rarely know the population SD ($\sigma$), we use the sample SD ($S$) instead:
  - $SE(\bar{Y}) = \frac{S(Y_i)}{\sqrt{n}}$
- The SE is about [precision]{.alert} and is used for inference (e.g., confidence intervals), while the SD is about the [variability of the data]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- [Example]{.alert}: For the same 50 students with $\bar{IQ} = 100$ and $SD = 15$
  - The [Standard Error (SE)]{.alert} is:
  - $SE = \frac{15}{\sqrt{50}} \approx 2.12$

- [What does this mean?]{.alert}
  - It describes the precision of your *sample average*
  - ["If you repeated the study with another 50 students, you would expect the new sample mean to be roughly 2.12 points away from the true population mean"]{.alert}
  - It answers the question: "How much would my sample average likely change if I took a new sample?"
:::
:::
:::

## The standard error of a difference in means

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
### The concept: Precision of the treatment effect

- In an experiment, we don't just care about one mean; we care about the [difference in means]{.alert} ($\bar{Y}_{1} - \bar{Y}_{0}$)
- Just as each sample mean has its own precision (its SE), the [difference between them also has a measure of precision]{.alert}
- The [standard error of the difference]{.alert} tells us how much we'd expect our estimated treatment effect to vary if we repeated the experiment
- [Analogy:]{.alert} Imagine trying to measure the height difference between two platforms, but both are a bit wobbly. The uncertainty in your final measurement comes from the wobbliness of *both* platforms
- The SE of the difference combines the uncertainty from both the treatment and control group means
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
### The formula & its use

- The uncertainty (variance) of a difference between two independent groups is the *sum* of their individual variances:
  - $Var(\bar{Y}_{1} - \bar{Y}_{0}) = Var(\bar{Y}_{1}) + Var(\bar{Y}_{0})$
- This leads to the formula for the standard error of the difference, which combines the variability ($S^2$) and sample size ($n$) from both groups:
  - $SE(\bar{Y}_{1} - \bar{Y}_{0})=\sqrt{\frac{S(Y_{1})^2}{n_{1}}+\frac{S(Y_{0})^2}{n_{0}}}$
- [Why it's crucial:]{.alert} This value is the foundation for hypothesis testing! It's the denominator in a t-test:
  - $t = \frac{\text{Difference in means}}{\text{SE of the difference}}$, or $t = \frac{\bar{Y}_{1} - \bar{Y}_{0}}{SE(\bar{Y}_{1} - \bar{Y}_{0})}$
- It also determines the width of the [confidence interval]{.alert} around our treatment effect
- While your software computes this for you 🤖, knowing what's "under the hood" helps you interpret your results! 😉

# Regression analysis of experiments 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Regression analysis of experiments

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- It is super easy to estimate the average treatment effect using [regression analysis]{.alert}
- Although some areas (e.g. medicine, psychology) often use $t$-tests for [difference-in-means]{.alert}, regression is more flexible and gives you exactly the same results
- The idea is to [regress the outcome variable on the treatment variable]{.alert} and some covariates if necessary
- But always report the ATE without covariates first, as it is the most interpretable
- Let's see an example using `R`! 🤓
- We will use the `fabricatr`, `estimatr`, and `randomizr` packages, which are part of the `DeclareDesign` suite
- More information about the packages is available [here](https://declaredesign.org/r/fabricatr/index.html), [here](https://declaredesign.org/r/randomizr/index.html), and [here](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr/index.html)
- We will start slowly, don't worry, and build up from there in the next lectures 😉
:::

## Simulating data in `R`

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=40%}
- Imagine that we want to estimate the effect of a job training programme on the number of interviews that unemployed individuals get, similar to the example we discussed earlier
- The treatment variable is `treat`, which takes the value 1 if the individual received the training and 0 otherwise
- We will assign 1000 individuals to the treatment and control groups, with an equal probability of being assigned to each group (simple random assignment)
- The outcome variable is `interviews`, which is the number of interviews the individual got after the training
- The treatment effect is 5, that is, individuals who received the training got 5 more interviews than those who did not
:::

:::{.column width=60%}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# Load the required packages
library(fabricatr)
library(estimatr)
library(randomizr)

# Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(385)

# Simulate the data
data <- fabricate( # fabricatr
  N = 1000, # base
  treat = simple_ra(N, prob = 0.5), # randomizr
  interviews = round(rnorm(N, mean = 10, sd = 2) + 5 * treat, digits = 0) # base
)

# Check the first few rows of the data
head(data)
```
:::
:::
:::

## Step-by-step: using `fabricatr` to simulate data

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- We used the `fabricate()` function from the `fabricatr` package to simulate the data
- The package is very flexible and was built for all types of data simulations, mainly those used by social scientists (e.g. experiments, surveys)
  - We can draw from Likert scales, create binary variables, ordinal variables, categorical variables, etc
  - More about how to create different types of variables [here](https://declaredesign.org/r/fabricatr/articles/common_social.html)
- The `fabricate()` function takes a series of arguments, which are the variables we want to simulate
- It uses base `R` functions too, which makes it easy to use
- For instance, `N = 1000` is the number of individuals in the sample and we created it using just base `R`
- To simulate the `interviews` variable, we used the `rnorm()` function to draw from a normal distribution with mean 10 and standard deviation 2
- We add 5 because it is the treatment effect
- As we cannot have a fraction of an interview, we used the `round()` function to round the number of interviews to the nearest integer (`digits = 0`)
- So far so good? 🤓
:::

## Randomising treatment assignment

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
- We used `simple_ra()` for simple random assignment, which is a simple coin flip. The arguments are:
  - `N`: the number of individuals in the sample (required)
  - `prob`: the probability of being assigned to the treatment group (optional)
  - `prob_each`: the probability of being assigned to each treatment group (optional)
- We could have used the `complete_ra()` function from the `randomizr` package to randomise the treatment assignment
- The function has a few arguments:
  - `N`: the number of individuals in the sample (required)
  - `m`: the number of individuals assigned to the treatment group (optional)
  - `m_each`: the number of individuals assigned to each treatment group (optional)
- We could also use `block_ra()` for block random assignment, which is when we divide the sample into blocks and then randomise within each block 
- `cluster_ra()` is used for cluster random assignment, which is when we randomise at the cluster level (e.g. schools, hospitals)
- Finally, `block_and_cluster_ra()` is used for block and cluster random assignment, which is a combination of the two
- We will discuss these functions in further detail in the next lectures 😉

## Estimating the treatment effect

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=35%}
- Now that we have the data, we can estimate the treatment effect using the `lm_robust()` function from the `estimatr` package
- The function is similar to the `lm()` function, but it uses robust standard errors, which are more appropriate for experiments
- Why? Because [robust standard errors correct for heteroskedasticity and clustering](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr/articles/mathematical-notes.html#lm_robust-notes)
- This is a free lunch: if your data is not heteroskedastic or clustered, the robust standard errors will be the same as the regular standard errors
- The function takes a formula as an argument, which is the outcome variable regressed on the treatment variable
:::

:::{.column width=65%}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
model <- lm_robust(interviews ~ treat, data = data)
summary(model)

## Difference in means

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- For those who would like to estimate the difference in means using the `t.test()` function, we've got you covered!  😉
- `estimatr` also has a function that does that, called `difference_in_means()` (what a surprise! 😂)
- It is actually more flexible than the `t.test()` function, as it can handle unit-randomised, cluster-randomised, block-randomised, matched-pair randomised, and matched-pair clustered designs. More [here](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr/articles/getting-started.html#difference_in_means)
- Here is how to use it:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

difference_in_means(interviews ~ treat, data = data)
```

- As you can see, the results are exactly the same as the regression model
- Just the output looks a little different, but the interpretation is the same
- Use whatever you feel more comfortable with! 😊
:::

## Interpreting the results

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=35%}
- The output of the `summary()` function gives us the [coefficient estimate]{.alert} of the treatment variable
- The intercept is `10.008`, which is the average number of interviews for the control group
- The coefficient of the treatment variable is `4.958`, which is the average treatment effect
- The standard error of the treatment effect is `0.129`, which is the standard error of the difference in means
- Our results are statistically significant at the 5% level, as the $p$-value is less than 0.05
:::

:::{.column width=65%}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
model <- lm_robust(interviews ~ treat, data = data)
summary(model)
```
- The `R^2` and its adjusted version are measures of the goodness-of-fit of the model
  - They are the proportion of the variance in the outcome variable explained by the model
- The `F` statistic is a test of the overall significance of the model
  - The null hypothesis is that all coefficients are zero
  - But as we see, the treatment variable is significant

## Including pre-treatment covariates in the model

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- We can also include covariates in the model to [increase precision]{.alert}
- In contrast with the treatment, the covariates have [no causal interpretation]{.alert}, that is, they are not affected by the treatment
- Even with randomisation, there can be [small imbalances]{.alert} in covariates between treatment and control groups, especially in small samples
- Including these covariates in the regression helps to adjust for any residual imbalances that may exist due to random chance, making the analysis more accurate
- Including covariates can also help bolster the credibility of the results by demonstrating that the treatment effect persists even after controlling for relevant variables
- But remember to include [only pre-treatment covariates]{.alert} in the model, as post-treatment covariates can introduce bias
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- Let's simulate a new dataset with two pre-treatment covariates: `age` and `education`

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
set.seed(385)

data2 <- fabricate(
  N = 1000,
  treat = complete_ra(N, m = 500),
  age = round(rnorm(N, mean = 30, sd = 5)),
  education = round(rnorm(N, mean = 12, sd = 2)),
  interviews = round(rnorm(N, mean = 10, sd = 2) + 5 * treat)
)

head(data2)
```

## Estimating the second model

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- We can add covariates to experimental models to increase precision
- The same way we do in any regression:
  - $Y_i = \alpha + \beta \text{T}_i + \gamma \text{X}_i + \epsilon_i$
- [Freedman (2008)](https://doi.org/10.1214/07-AOAS143) demonstrated that pre-treatment covariate adjustment may bias estimates of average treatment effects in small samples
  - In small samples, covariates and treatment assignment may not be perfectly independent
- [Lin (2013)](https://doi.org/10.1214/12-AOAS583) proposed that if covariate correlations differ between treatment and control groups, centring and interacting covariates with the treatment variable will balance the groups
- This adjusts for covariates separately in each group, which is equivalent to including treatment-by-covariate interactions
  - $Y_i = \alpha + \beta \text{T}_i + \gamma \text{W}_i + \delta \text{T}_i \times \text{W}_i + \epsilon_i$
  - Where $W_i = \text{X}_i - \bar{\text{X}}$ and $\bar{\text{X}}$ is the mean of $\text{X}_i$
  - For ease of interpretation, we can centre the covariates to have a mean of zero
- Anyway, worry not! 😅 Our friends at [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/r/estimatr/articles/getting-started.html#lm_lin) have done all the work for us and created a function called `lm_lin()` that does everything automatically!

## Estimating the second model

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=65%}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
model2 <- lm_lin(interviews ~ treat,
                covariates = ~ age + education,
                data = data2)
summary(model2)
```
:::

:::{.column width=35%}
- The `lm_lin()` function is similar to the `lm_robust()` function, but it includes the `covariates` argument
- We pass a simple `R` formula to it
- As you can see, the results are pretty similar to the previous model
# Summarise results
- The `_c` part of the variable names indicates that the variables are centred, as recommended by Lin (2013)

## Sub-group analysis

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=35%}
- We can also estimate the treatment effect for sub-groups of the population
- This is useful when we suspect that the treatment effect may vary across known dimensions
- For instance, we can estimate the treatment effect for people with high and low levels of education
- We can do this by [including an interaction term between the treatment variable and the covariate of interest]{.alert}
- We will discuss this in further detail in the next lectures, but here is how to do it
:::

:::{.column width=65%}
```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Create a binary subgroup (e.g., "high" vs. "low" education)
data2$high_edu <- ifelse(data2$education > median(data2$education), 1, 0)

# Fit an interaction model with covariates
model_interaction <- lm_robust(
  interviews ~ treat * high_edu + age + education,
  data = data2)

# Summarize results
summary(model_interaction)
```

## Sub-group analysis: interpreting the results

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 19px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=35%}
- The output of the `summary()` function gives us the [coefficient estimate]{.alert} of the treatment variable for the high education group 
  - It is in the last line, `treat:high_edu`
- [Interpretation]{.alert}: The treatment effect for the high-education subgroup (`high_edu = 1`) is 0.097 larger than for the low-education subgroup 
- Total treatment effect for `high_edu = 1`: 5.101 + 0.097 = 5.198 
- [Significance]{.alert}: The interaction is not significant (CI: -0.395 to 0.590), meaning there’s no evidence the treatment effect differs between education subgroups
- This is expected, as we simulated the data to have the same treatment effect for all individuals (5)
- But it is good to know how to do it, right? 😉

# The challenge of generalisation 🤔 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Extrapolation from experiments

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Experiments yield estimates (like the SATE) specific to the [sample, setting, treatment details, and time]{.alert} of the study
- However, research aims to answer broader questions: 
  - How do these findings [fit with existing literature?]{.alert} 
  - What are the implications for [theory]{.alert}? 
  - What [policy recommendations]{.alert} follow?
- Answering these requires [extrapolation]{.alert}, that is, extending conclusions beyond the precise conditions of the experiment
- This process involves [additional assumptions and some educated guesswork]{.alert}, moving away from the strong causal footing provided by randomisation

## Uncertainty and bias

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Extrapolation can also introduce systematic [bias]{.alert}:
  - [Sampling bias]{.alert}: Convenience samples (common in field experiments) might not represent the broader population of interest
  - [Publication bias]{.alert}: Statistically significant or 'interesting' results are often more likely to be published, skewing the available literature
  - [Contextual changes]{.alert}: Underlying conditions governing cause and effect might shift over time or across locations
  - [Measurement bias]{.alert}: Variations in how outcomes are measured can lead to inconsistencies in reported effects
- Even a direct replication involves a new sample and potentially subtle contextual shifts

- [Replication]{.alert}: Conducting a *new* experiment that uses the [same design]{.alert} (treatments, outcome measures, general procedures) as an earlier study, often in a similar setting with similar subjects
  - The goal is to assess the [robustness and generalisability]{.alert} of the original finding

- [Verification]{.alert}: Taking the [original data]{.alert} from a completed study and attempting to [reproduce the reported statistical results]{.alert}.
  - Here, the goal is to check for [clerical errors]{.alert}, understand the impact of specific analytical choices, and assess the sensitivity of results to different modelling decisions

# Estimating population average treatment effects (PATE) 🌎 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## From sample to population

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Sample Average Treatment Effect (SATE)]{.alert}: Average causal effect specifically within the group of individuals included in our experiment
- Often, our real interest lies in the [Population Average Treatment Effect (PATE)]{.alert}: This represents the average effect we would expect if [the treatment were applied to the entire population]{.alert} from which our sample was drawn
- Thinking about [replication studies]{.alert} (which involve drawing new samples) highlights the shift from considering only within-sample randomisation variability (for SATE) to considering [sample-to-sample variability]{.alert} (for PATE).
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- If experimental subjects are selected via [random sampling]{.alert} from a well-defined, large population, we can statistically estimate the PATE and quantify the uncertainty around that estimate
- This involves an [additional layer of uncertainty]{.alert} compared to just estimating the SATE, because our specific sample might not perfectly mirror the population due to random chance
  - The [standard error of the PATE is usually larger]{.alert} than that of the SATE, reflecting this added uncertainty
:::
:::
:::

## Quantifying uncertainty

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Under ideal conditions ([independent random sampling]{.alert} from a fixed, large population $N*$), the standard error of the estimated PATE ($SE(\widehat{PATE})$) is given by:

  $$SE(\widehat{PATE}) = \sqrt{ \frac{Var(Y_i(1))}{m} + \frac{Var(Y_i(0))}{N-m} } \quad$$

- $Var(Y_i(1))$ and $Var(Y_i(0))$ are the [variances of potential outcomes in the population]{.alert} under treatment and control
- These are typically estimated using the variances observed in the treatment and control groups of our sample
- $m$ is the number of subjects in the treatment group, and $N-m$ is the number in the control group
- This formula differs from the SATE standard error because it relies on population variances and, due to the assumption of a large population $N*$, the covariance between potential outcomes is assumed to be zero

# A Bayesian framework for interpretation 📈 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Updating beliefs with evidence

:::{style="font-size: 26px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Because generalisation involves inference beyond the data at hand, a [Bayesian approach]{.alert} provides a useful conceptual and analytical framework
- Bayesian inference views probability as representing a [subjective degree of belief]{.alert} about a hypothesis or parameter value
- The process involves the following steps:
  1.  Starting with [prior beliefs]{.alert} about the parameter (e.g., the PATE) before seeing the current study's results
  2.  Observing the [evidence]{.alert} from the new experiment
  3.  Using [Bayes' Rule]{.alert} to combine the prior beliefs and the evidence to form updated [posterior beliefs]{.alert}
- This framework explicitly models how our understanding should rationally change as new information becomes available
:::

## Priors and posteriors 
### Characterising beliefs

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [**Prior Beliefs**]{.alert}: Our knowledge or belief about a parameter (like the PATE) *before* considering the evidence from the current experiment
  - Often expressed as a probability distribution (e.g., assuming the PATE follows a normal distribution with a certain mean and variance)
  - The mean reflects the best guess, and the variance reflects the degree of prior uncertainty
  - Can be based on previous studies, theory, or expert judgement
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [**Posterior Beliefs**]{.alert}: Our [updated]{.alert} state of knowledge or belief *after* incorporating the evidence from the experiment
  - Also expressed as a probability distribution
  - Mathematically derived by combining the prior distribution and the likelihood of the observed data (which reflects the experimental result and its precision)
  - Represents a [compromise (weighed average) between prior beliefs and the new evidence]{.alert}. Stronger priors or less precise evidence lead to smaller updates
:::
:::
:::

## Bayes' rule for discrete outcomes
### Updating beliefs about a hypothesis

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Consider a simple hypothesis $H$ (e.g., the treatment has a positive effect) and evidence $E$ from an experiment (e.g., the result is statistically significant at the $0.05$ level)
- We need:
  - [Prior P(H)]{.alert}: Our belief in $H$ before the experiment
  - [P(E|H)]{.alert}: The probability of observing evidence $E$ if $H$ is true (this is related to the statistical power of the test)
  - [P(E|~H)]{.alert}: The probability of observing $E$ if $H$ is false (this is the Type I error rate, e.g., $0.05$)
- Bayes' Rule gives the [Posterior P(H|E)]{.alert}, our belief in $H$ after observing $E$:

  $$ P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|\neg H)(1-P(H))} $$

- *Example:* If $P(H)=0.5$ (50/50 prior), $P(E|H)=0.45$ (power), and $P(E|~H)=0.05$ (sig. level), then $P(H|E) = 0.90$
:::

## Bayesian updating with normal distributions
### Estimating a continuous parameter (PATE)

:::{style="font-size: 24px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Let's apply this to estimate a continuous parameter, the PATE, denoted $\tau$
- [**Prior beliefs**]{.alert}: Assume our prior beliefs about $\tau$ can be represented by a normal distribution with mean $g$ (our best guess) and variance $\sigma^2_g$
- [**Experimental result**]{.alert}: The experiment yields an estimate $x_e$ with a standard error $\sigma_{xe}$, so its variance is $\sigma^2_{xe}$
- [**Likelihood**]{.alert}: Assuming the experimental estimate $X_e$ follows a normal sampling distribution centred on the true PATE ($\tau$), the likelihood is also normal (conjugate priors)
:::
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [**Posterior beliefs**]{.alert}: When both the prior and the likelihood are normal, the resulting posterior distribution for $\tau$ is also normal
- The [mean and variance of this posterior distribution]{.alert} are calculated as a weighted average of the prior information and the experimental evidence, reflecting the relative precision of each
- We will now incorporate the possibility of bias in the experimental estimate of the PATE
:::
:::
:::

## Visualising the Bayesian update

:::{style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="40%"}
- Consider a simple case (initially ignoring bias):
  - [Prior belief about PATE]{.alert}: Centred at $g=0$ with standard deviation $\sigma_g=2$ (variance $\sigma^2_g=4$)
  - [Experimental result]{.alert}: Estimate $x_e=10$ with standard error $SE_{xe}=1$ (variance $\sigma^2_{xe}=1$)
- The [Posterior belief about PATE]{.alert} will be:
  - A normal distribution
  - Centred between the prior mean ($0$) and the data ($10$)
  - More precise (smaller variance) than the prior in our example
- In this example, the posterior mean is $8$, and the posterior standard deviation is approximately $0.89$. The data, being more precise than the prior, pulls the posterior belief strongly towards it

## Calculating the posterior (normal-normal case) 

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 20px;"}
- It is often easier to work with [precision]{.alert}, which is defined as the [inverse of the variance]{.alert}: $\text{precision} = 1 / \sigma^2$
    - [Small variance]{.alert} means low uncertainty and [high precision]{.alert}
    - [Large variance]{.alert} means the opposite: high uncertainty and [low precision]{.alert}
    - Prior precision: $\rho_{prior} = 1 / \sigma^2_{prior}$
    - Data precision: $\rho_{data} = 1 / \sigma^2_{data}$
- The [posterior precision]{.alert} is simply the [sum]{.alert} of the prior and data precisions:
    $$\rho_{posterior} = \rho_{prior} + \rho_{data}$$
    - This addition reflects how combining information increases our overall certainty
- The [posterior mean]{.alert} is a [precision-weighted average]{.alert} of the prior mean and the data:
    $$\mu_{posterior} = \frac{\rho_{prior} \mu_{prior} + \rho_{data} x_e}{\rho_{posterior}} = \frac{(1/\sigma^2_{prior}) \mu_{prior} + (1/\sigma^2_{data}) x_e}{(1/\sigma^2_{prior}) + (1/\sigma^2_{data})}$$
    - Information sources with higher precision (lower variance) receive more weight in determining the final posterior belief
- The [posterior variance]{.alert} is the inverse of the posterior precision: $\sigma^2_{posterior} = 1 / \rho_{posterior}$
:::

## R code for Bayesian update (normal-normal)

:::{style="font-size: 20px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Let's apply this to the example from Figure 11.1, calculating precisions first

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

# Prior
prior_mean <- 0
prior_se <- 2
prior_var <- prior_se^2
# Prior precision
prior_precision <- 1 / prior_var

# Experimental data
data_mean <- 10 
data_se <- 1
data_var <- data_se^2
# Calculate data precision
data_precision <- 1 / data_var

# Posterior precision
posterior_precision <- prior_precision + data_precision

# Posterior variance and SE
posterior_var <- 1 / posterior_precision
posterior_se <- sqrt(posterior_var)

# Posterior mean (precision-weighted average)
posterior_mean <- (prior_precision * prior_mean + data_precision * data_mean) / posterior_precision

# Print Results
cat("Prior Mean:", prior_mean, " Prior SE:", prior_se, " Prior Precision:", round(prior_precision, 2), "\n")
cat("Data Mean:", data_mean, "  Data SE:", data_se, "  Data Precision:", round(data_precision, 2), "\n")
cat("Posterior Mean:", round(posterior_mean, 2), " Posterior SE:", round(posterior_se, 2), " Posterior Precision:", round(posterior_precision, 2), "\n")

```

## Incorporating potential bias
### When the experiment might be biased for PATE

:::{style="font-size: 25px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Now, let's consider the more realistic scenario where our experiment might yield an unbiased estimate of the *Sample* ATE, but due to [non-random sampling or other factors]{.alert}, it might be a biased estimate of the *Population* ATE ($\tau$)
- Let $B$ represent this potential [sampling bias]{.alert}, such that the expected experimental result, given the true PATE $\tau$, is $\tau + B$
- We need to expand our Bayesian model to include prior beliefs about this bias term $B$
- Assume $B \sim N(\beta, \sigma^2_B)$, where $\beta$ is our prior belief about the bias and $\sigma^2_B$ is our uncertainty about it
- We typically assume that our prior beliefs about the true effect $\tau$ and the bias $B$ are independent
:::

## Posterior mean and variance with bias
### Updating beliefs about PATE ($\tau$)

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We define the [data's effective precision]{.alert} for estimating $\tau$ as:

$$\rho_{effective\_data} = \frac{1}{\sigma^2_B + \sigma^2_{xe}}$$

- [Higher uncertainty about the bias ($\sigma^2_B$) directly *reduces* the effective precision of the data]{.alert}
- Think of [bias uncertainty as adding noise]{.alert} to $\tau$
- Researchers implicitly setting $\beta = 0$ and $\sigma^2_B = 0$ when extrapolating from convenience samples risk [significant overconfidence]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- The [posterior mean]{.alert} becomes a weighted average using the prior precision ($\rho_{prior}$) and the data's *effective* precision ($\rho_{effective\_data}$) as weights:

$$\mu_{posterior} = \frac{\rho_{prior} g + \rho_{effective\_data} (x_e - \beta)}{\rho_{prior} + \rho_{effective\_data}}$$

- The [posterior variance]{.alert} also incorporates bias uncertainty, making the final belief less certain than if bias were ignored:

$$\sigma^2_{posterior} = \frac{1}{\rho_{prior} + \rho_{effective\_data}}$$    
:::
:::
:::

## R code for update with bias beliefs

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- Now we add prior beliefs about the bias (mean `bias_mean` = $\beta$, se `bias_se` = $\sigma_B$) and test the impact of different levels of uncertainty about the bias on the posterior mean and variance

## Application: combining studies
### Experiment + observational study

:::{style="font-size: 32px; margin-top: 30px;"}
- This Bayesian framework is flexible and can integrate different kinds of evidence.
- Imagine using results from a high-quality, [unbiased randomised experiment]{.alert} to establish your prior beliefs about the PATE ($g, \sigma^2_g$)
- You could then update these priors using findings from a large, but potentially [biased observational study]{.alert} ($x_e, \sigma^2_{xe}$)
- To do this rigorously, you must explicitly state your prior beliefs about the [bias of the observational study]{.alert} ($\beta, \sigma^2_B$)

## Meta-Analysis
### Systematically combining results

:::{style="font-size: 23px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Meta-analysis]{.alert} is a set of statistical techniques designed to synthesise or pool results from multiple related studies
- Often, individual studies might be small or lack statistical power, but [combining their results can lead to a more precise and clearer conclusion]{.alert}
- It is a [widely used method]{.alert} for summarising research literatures across many disciplines, mainly in the health sciences
- The most basic form, known as [fixed effects meta-analysis]{.alert}, has strong parallels with the Bayesian updating process described earlier, particularly under the assumption of no bias

## Fixed effects meta-analysis

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="55%"}
- [Assumption]{.alert}: All studies ($k=1, ..., K$) included in the analysis are estimating the [exact same underlying true population treatment effect]{.alert}, $\tau$. Any variation in results is due purely to random sampling error.
- [Method]{.alert}: Calculate a pooled estimate ($ ATE_{pooled} $) as a weighted average of the individual study estimates ($ ATE_k $).
- [Weighting]{.alert}: Each study's contribution is weighted by its [precision]{.alert}. Studies with smaller standard errors (higher precision) receive more weight.

$$ATE_{pooled} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k ATE_k}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{K} (ATE_k / SE_k^2)}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} (1 / SE_k^2)}$$
:::
:::{.column width="45%"}
- [Standard error of pooled estimate]{.alert}: The variance of the pooled estimate is the inverse of the sum of the precisions:
  
$$Var(ATE_{pooled}) = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} w_k} = \frac{1}{\sum_{k=1}^{K} (1 / SE_k^2)}$$

$$SE_{pooled} = \sqrt{Var(ATE_{pooled})}$$

- The resulting [pooled standard error will be smaller]{.alert} than the standard error of any individual study included in the meta-analysis, reflecting the gain in precision from combining evidence
:::
:::
:::

## When is fixed effects meta-analysis appropriate?

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- This simple pooling method rests on several [strong and often unrealistic assumptions]{.alert}:
  1.  [Homogeneity of Effect]{.alert}: All studies are estimating precisely the same true effect size $\tau$. There is no real variation in the effect across different populations, settings, or minor treatment variations
  2.  [Independence of Studies]{.alert}: The results of the studies are statistically independent (often violated if studies share researchers, settings, or are aware of each other)
  3.  [No Bias]{.alert}: Each individual study estimate ($ATE_k$) is assumed to be an unbiased estimate of the common true effect $\tau$. Potential biases (sampling, publication, etc.) are ignored
- These assumptions are [particularly questionable when pooling studies across diverse contexts or designs]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- These assumptions can be [relaxed with more complex models]{.alert}:
  - [Random effects meta-analysis]{.alert}: Assumes that the true effect size varies across studies, allowing for a distribution of effect sizes rather than a single common effect
  - [Hierarchical models]{.alert}: Can model both within-study and between-study variability
- However, results can be heavily skewed by [publication bias]{.alert} (the "file drawer problem")
- Techniques exist to detect this (e.g., funnel plots) but cannot fully correct for it
- Let's see how to conduct one in practice (all of it!)

# Case study: Legislature size and government spending 💰 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Step 01: Scrap data

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- My colleagues and I conducted a meta-analysis of the effects of [legislature size on government spending]{.alert} 
- All information is available at <https://github.com/danilofreire/legislature-size-meta-analysis>
- To find the articles, we used Google Scholar (n = 1001); Microsoft Academic (n = 927); and Scopus (n = 736) and searched for the following keywords:
- `("upper chamber size" OR "lower chamber size" OR "council size" OR "parliament size"
OR "legislature size" OR "number of legislators" OR "legislative size") AND ("spending" OR "expenditure"
OR "government size")`
- We also searched all articles that cited the original work on the effects of legislature size on government spending, and ended up with [5,705 records]{.alert}

## Step 02: Extract data

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- Then, we used the [PRISMA guidelines](https://www.prisma-statement.org/) to select the articles that met our inclusion criteria:
  - We selected only articles in English, and discarded duplicates, PhD theses, and book chapters
  - We excluded articles by title, then by abstract, then by full text (two independent coders)
  - The paper should (i) conduct a quantitative analysis, (ii) report data on the number of legislators, and (iii) also include data on public expenditure
- We then extracted all ATEs and standard errors from the articles to conduct two analyses:
  - One with the [most strict model]{.alert} and one with [all models]{.alert}
- We ended up with 30 articles, with 45 estimates in the strict sample, 162 in the complete sample

## Step 03: Collect moderators

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We believed that the effects of legislature size on government spending would be moderated by:
  - [Independent variable]{.alert} (upper chamber size, lower chamber size, or council size)
  - [Year]{.alert}
  - [Methodology]{.alert} (OLS, RDD, IV, panel)
  - [Publication]{.alert} (yes or no)
  - [Institutional design]{.alert} (bicameralism, unicameralism, mixed)
  - [Electoral system]{.alert} (majoritarian or proportional)
- These variables are useful to estimate [meta-regression]{.alert} models, which allow us to estimate the effect of moderators on the ATE

## Step 04: Conduct meta-analysis

:::{style="font-size: 21px; margin-top: 30px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- We used the [`meta`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/meta/index.html) `R` package to conduct the meta-analysis
- Although we did estimate fixed effect models, the main models had [random effects], which are more appropriate for our data
- Instead of having $\tau = \theta + \varepsilon$ (true effect + within study error), we assumed that $\theta$ varies across studies, having a true parameter $\mu$ and a between-study error $\xi_i$: 

$$\tau = \mu + \xi_i + \varepsilon_i$$

-  We added two levels to the models: publication ID for each paper, and a a common index for papers that share the
same data 
- We found [a lot of heterogeneity]{.alert} in the data! 
- But the meta-regressions also helped us understand the main drivers of the differences in the ATE 🤓

Here is one of the many figures we produced. As you can see, the main effect is close to zero and there is a lot of variability in the estimates

# Conclusion 📝 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Key takeaways

:::{style="font-size: 22px; margin-top: 20px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Generalising experimental findings]{.alert} is surely challenging, as it introduces uncertainty and the potential for bias
- It's important to distinguish between the [SATE]{.alert} (effect in the sample) and the [PATE]{.alert} (effect in the target population). Estimating the PATE requires accounting for sampling variability.
- [Convenience sampling]{.alert} complicates PATE estimation and makes standard error calculation based on random sampling assumptions inappropriate.
- The [Bayesian framework]{.alert} offers a coherent way to integrate prior knowledge with new evidence and explicitly model uncertainty about potential biases
:::

:::{.column width="50%"}
- [Meta-analysis]{.alert} provides tools for pooling study results, but standard methods (like fixed effects) rely on strong, often unmet, assumptions (e.g., homogeneity of effects, no publication bias, no sampling bias).
- [Statistical models]{.alert} facilitate interpolation and extrapolation but depend on correct specification [Prediction uncertainty escalates rapidly]{.alert} as one moves further from the range of observed data
- Transparency about [assumptions is required]{.alert} when integrating findings or extrapolating results

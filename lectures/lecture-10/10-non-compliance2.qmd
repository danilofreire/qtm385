# Hi, there! <br> Hope all is well! 😉 {background-color="#2d4563"}

# Brief recap 📚 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Last class

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [One-sided non-compliance]{.alert} occurs when units in the treatment group fail to receive the intervention, while control group members remain unaffected
- This scenario introduces two key groups: 
  - [Compliers]{.alert}: Subjects who accept treatment when assigned 
  - [Never-takers]{.alert}: Subjects who reject treatment regardless of assignment 
- The [intent-to-treat (ITT)]{.alert} effect measures the impact of treatment assignment, while the [complier average causal effect (CACE)]{.alert} estimates the true effect on those who actually received treatment
- CACE can be calculated via: $CACE = \frac{ITT_Y}{ITT_D}$
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- [Instrumental variables (IV)]{.alert} methods like [two-stage least squares (2SLS)]{.alert} are preferred for estimation: 
  - Regress treatment receipt on assignment (`D ~ Z`)
  - Use predicted treatment status to estimate outcome effects (`Y ~ D_hat`)
  - `estimatr::iv_robust(Y ~ D | Z, data = data)`
- [Placebo designs]{.alert} help validate IV assumptions by testing compliers against non-treatment conditions
- We should anticipate non-compliance through [large sample sizes]{.alert} and [robust experimental designs]{.alert} to maintain internal validity

# Two-sided non-compliance 🤔 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Non-compliance: You already know it's a problem
### Now it will get worse 😂

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
- Last class, we discussed one-sided non-compliance
- We saw that [ATE is not estimable]{.alert} in this scenario, as treatment and control groups are no longer comparable ([selection bias risk]{.alert})
- We also learned how to estimate the [CACE]{.alert} using [IV methods]{.alert}, which is [the difference in observed treatment and control group outcomes divided by the proportion of subjects who are compliers]{.alert}
- Today, we will discuss two-sided non-compliance, which is even more complex
- In this scenario, some subjects in the treatment group do not receive treatment, while some in the control group do
- [Underestimation of treatment effect]{.alert}: If some in the treatment group don't comply, and some in the control group get treatment, the difference between the groups in terms of [actual treatment received becomes smaller]{.alert} 
- This can make it look like the treatment is [less effective than it actually is]{.alert}. We "dilute" the treatment effect 🤓
:::

# Compliance types 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Four types of compliance

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- So far, we have discussed [Compliers]{.alert} and [Never-takers]{.alert}
- In two-sided non-compliance, we also have [Always-takers]{.alert} and [Defiers]{.alert}
- [Always-takers]{.alert}: Subjects who always seek treatment, regardless of assignment 
- [Defiers]{.alert}: Subjects who do the opposite of their assignment: Imagine stubborn teenagers! 😂
- Many experiments face this issue, especially in social sciences
  - [Encouragement designs]{.alert}: For example, students who receive private school vouchers but still attend public schools, but some students in the control group attend private schools even without vouchers
  - [Natural experiments]{.alert}: Lottery defined who would be drafted to the Vietnam War, but some drafted soldiers avoided service, while some non-drafted soldiers volunteered
- Fortunately, the estimation is [similar to one-sided non-compliance]{.alert}, just with more assumptions
:::

## Four types of compliance

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- More formally, we have the following:
- $Z_i$ is the treatment assignment, $D_i$ is the treatment receipt, and $Y_i$ is the outcome
- [Compliers]{.alert}: $D_i(1) = 1$ and $D_i(0) = 0$. Similarly, $D_i(1) \gt D_i(0)$
- [Never-takers]{.alert}: $D_i(1) = 0$ and $D_i(0) = 0$
- [Always-takers]{.alert}: $D_i(1) = 1$ and $D_i(0) = 1$
- [Defiers]{.alert}: $D_i(1) = 0$ and $D_i(0) = 1$. These are usually rare, though

- Connections between observed data and compliance types:

|         | $Z_i = 0$             | $Z_i = 1$             |
|---------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| $D_i = 0$ | Never-taker or Complier | Never-taker or Defier |
| $D_i = 1$ | Always-taker or Defier  | Always-taker or Complier |

:::{style="margin-top: 20px;"}
:::

- Notice that treatment assignment has [no effect on whether always-takers or never-takers are treated]{.alert} 
  - Always-takers are treated regardless of assignment, while never-takers are never treated
- [Defiers and compliers]{.alert}, on the other hand, respond to treatment assignment, but in opposite ways
  - So the problem is that we can't tell who is who, and this makes estimation difficult! 🤔
:::

## How to solve this? 🤔
### Motivating example: Candidate debate study

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- [Mullainathan et al. (2010)](https://sendhil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Book-Chapter-5.pdf) designed a study to measure the impact of watching a political debate on voting intentions
- [Treatment group]{.alert}: Encouraged to watch debate
- [Control group]{.alert}: Encouraged to watch non-political programme
- [Treatment defined as self-reported debate viewing]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- [Always-Takers]{.alert}: Watch debate regardless of encouragement
- [Never-Takers]{.alert}: Never watch debate, even if encouraged
- [Compliers]{.alert}: Watch debate only when encouraged
- [Defiers]{.alert}: Watch debate only when discouraged (watch non-political programme)
- [Compliance type]{.alert} is a fixed attribute in this design
  - If the design was different, compliance types could change!
:::
:::
:::

## Quantifying compliance
### Estimating group sizes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 22px;"}
- Let $\pi_{AT}$, $\pi_{NT}$, $\pi_{C}$, $\pi_{D}$ denote proportions of Always-Takers, Never-Takers, Compliers, and Defiers

- [Always-Takers' share ($\pi_{AT}$):]{.alert}
    $$ \pi_{AT} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i(1)d_i(0) $$

- The term is 1 only for individuals who would take the treatment regardless of their assignment ($d_i(1)=1$ and $d_i(0)=1$)

- [Never-Takers' share ($\pi_{NT}$):]{.alert}

    $$ \pi_{NT} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (1-d_i(1))(1-d_i(0)) $$

- The term is 1 only for those who would refuse the treatment regardless of their assignment ($d_i(1)=0$ and $d_i(0)=0$)
:::

## Quantifying compliance
### Estimating group sizes

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- These are the remaining formulas for the Compliers and Defiers

- [Compliers' share ($\pi_{C}$):]{.alert}
    $$ \pi_{C} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_i(1)(1-d_i(0)) $$

- The term is 1 only for those who follow their assignment—taking the treatment if offered ($d_i(1)=1$) and not otherwise ($d_i(0)=0$).

- [Defiers' share ($\pi_{D}$):]{.alert}
    $$ \pi_{D} = 1 - \pi_{AT} - \pi_{NT} - \pi_{C} $$

- This is an accounting identity. Since everyone must be in one of the four groups, their shares must sum to 1
:::


## Quantifying compliance
### Numbers from the debate study

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Under random assignment, [the assigned treatment group has the same expected shares of Always-Takers, Never-Takers, Compliers, and Defiers as the assigned control group]{.alert} 
  - Right? Why or why not?
- [In the control group]{.alert}, the untreated subjects are either Never-Takers or Compliers
  - The study of the New York City mayoral debates found that 84% of the control group reported not watching the debate, so $\hat{\pi}_{NT} + \hat{\pi}_{C} = 0.84$
  - Subjects in the control group who watched the debate are either Always-Takers or Defiers, and $\hat{\pi}_{AT} + \hat{\pi}_{D} = 0.16$
- [In the treatment group]{.alert}, 37% of the subjects reported watching the debate
  - These subjects must be either Always-Takers or Compliers, so $\hat{\pi}_{AT} + \hat{\pi}_{C} = 0.37$
  - The remaining 63% are either Never-Takers or Defiers, so $\hat{\pi}_{NT} + \hat{\pi}_{D} = 0.63$
- But we don't know how many people are in each group, as mentioned before
- We can estimate these proportions with a trick...
:::

# Monotonicity 📏 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Monotonicity assumption
### No defiers allowed! 😂

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- [Monotonicity]{.alert} is a key assumption in two-sided non-compliance
- It states that no subject is a [Defier]{.alert}: No one does the opposite of their assignment
- This is a [strong assumption too]{.alert}, as it is possible that _someone_ does the opposite of what they were told
- But if we assume that's not the case (no defiers), all problems are solved! 😂
- In our previous example:
  - If we assume that no one watched the debate when they were told not to, we can estimate the proportions of each group

- [Always-Takers ($\hat{\pi}_{AT}$)]{.alert} are estimated by the share of people in the control group who took the treatment
        $$ \hat{\pi}_{AT} = \text{Proportion}(Treatment=Yes \,|\, Assigned=Control) $$

- [Never-Takers ($\hat{\pi}_{NT}$)]{.alert} are estimated by the share of people in the treatment group who did _not_ take the treatment
        $$ \hat{\pi}_{NT} = \text{Proportion}(Treatment=No \,|\, Assigned=Treatment) $$

- [Compliers ($\hat{\pi}_{C}$)]{.alert} are the rest of the population.
        $$ \hat{\pi}_{C} = 1 - \hat{\pi}_{AT} - \hat{\pi}_{NT} $$
:::

## Monotonicity assumption
###  Simplifying the Model

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 27px;"}
- Assume [no Defiers]{.alert} ($\pi_{D} = 0$) to simplify estimation
- With $\pi_{D} = 0$, we can estimate all proportions using observed data:
    - [Always-Takers]{.alert} ($\hat{\pi}_{AT}$), people who watch the debate while in the control group:
    - $\hat{\pi}_{AT} + \hat{\pi}_{D} = 0.16 \implies \hat{\pi}_{AT} = 0.16$
    - [Never-Takers]{.alert} ($\hat{\pi}_{NT}$), those who never watch the debate even when in the treatment group:
    - $\hat{\pi}_{NT} + \hat{\pi}_{D} = 0.63 \implies \hat{\pi}_{NT} = 0.63$
    - [Compliers]{.alert} ($\hat{\pi}_{C}$), those who watch the debate only when encouraged:
    - $\hat{\pi}_{AT} + \hat{\pi}_{C} = 0.37 \implies \hat{\pi}_{C} = 0.37 - \hat{\pi}_{AT} = 0.37 - 0.16 = 0.21$
    - Alternatively, $\hat{\pi}_{C} = 1 - \hat{\pi}_{AT} - \hat{\pi}_{NT} = 1 - 0.16 - 0.63 = 0.21$
:::

# Now the easy part, CACE estimation 🤓 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Estimating CACE
### Now we know what to do! 😉

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 25px;"}
 - Once we [eliminate defiers]{.alert}, we can estimate the [CACE]{.alert} using the same formula as before
 - The [CACE]{.alert} is the [difference in observed treatment and control group outcomes divided by the proportion of subjects who are compliers]{.alert}
- Why do we need to divide by $ITT_D$? Because the treatment group is a mix of compliers (who take the treatment) and never-takers (who do not)
- If we include both, we are underestimating the treatment effect, because never-takers do not receive the treatment and their outcomes are not affected by it
- In two-sided non-compliance, we also have always-takers in the control group, who receive the treatment regardless of assignment. We have to account for them too
:::

# Back to our example 📊 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Estimating CACE in the debate study
### Let's see how all this works in practice! 😉

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Remember [Mullainathan et al. (2010)](https://sendhil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Book-Chapter-5.pdf) initial experimental design:
  - [Treatment group]{.alert}: Encouraged to watch debate
  - [Control group]{.alert}: Encouraged to watch non-political programme
  - [Treatment defined as self-reported debate viewing]{.alert}
- Now let's analyse a subset of their data in the table below:

:::{style="margin-top: 20px; text-align: center; font-size: 28px;"}

|                                  | Treatment group | Control group |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|---------------|
| % Reporting change (N treated)   | 59.5 (185)      | 50.0 (80)     |
| % Reporting change (N untreated) | 40.6 (320)      | 40.2 (415)    |
| % Reporting change (total N)     | 47.5 (505)      | 41.8 (495)    |

:::

## Does it seem confusing? 🤔
### Let's break it down! 😉

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- The study $N$ is 1000, with 505 in the treatment group and 495 in the control group
  - These are the total $N$ in each group, in parentheses, last row of the table
- What about those who were actually treated?
  - 185 in the treatment group and 80 in the control group (huge non-compliance!) 
  - These are the $N$ treated, in parentheses, first row of the table
- And those who were not treated?
  - 320 in the treatment group and 415 in the control group
  - These are the $N$ untreated, in parentheses, second row of the table
- How to calculate CACE here? Remember that $CACE = \frac{ITT_Y}{ITT_D}$
- $ITT_Y$ is the difference in outcomes between treatment and control groups
  - $ITT_Y = 47.5 - 41.8 = 5.7$, or $0.057$ in percentage points
- So far so good? 😉
:::

## Calculating CACE
### Let's do the maths again! 😉

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 23px;"}
- $ITT_Y = 0.057$, right?
- Now let's calculate $ITT_D$:
  - $ITT_D = 36.6 - 16.2 = 20.4$, or $0.204$ in percentage points
- [Wait a minute!]{.alert} Where do these numbers come from?
  - Remember that only 185 people were treated in the treatment group
  - $\frac{185}{505} \times 100 \approx 36.6$% were treated in the treatment group [Aha!]{.alert} 😂
- Control group "treatment" rate (non-compliance):
  - $\frac{80}{495} \times 100 \approx 16.2$% reported change in the control group
- So, $ITT_D = 20.4$ or $0.204$ in percentage points. Let's keep it in percentage points for now 😉
- Finally, $CACE = \frac{ITT_Y}{ITT_D} = \frac{0.057}{0.204} \approx 0.28$
- So, the [CACE]{.alert} is $0.28$! Woo-hoo! 🥳
- In fancy words: "[The estimate suggests that watching the debates raises the rate at which Compliers report opinion change by 28 percentage points.]{.alert}"
:::

## Wait, there's more! 🤓
### Using IVs to estimate CACE

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 26px;"}
- Remember that I said we could use [IV methods]{.alert} to estimate the [CACE]{.alert}?
- It works the same way as in one-sided non-compliance, but with the ["no defiers" (monotonicity)]{.alert} assumption
- We regress treatment receipt on assignment, and then use predicted treatment status to estimate outcome effects
- The formula is the same: `estimatr::iv_robust(Y ~ D | Z, data = data)`
- The `estimatr` package is your friend here once again! 😉
- Since we don't live in the Stone Age any longer, we can use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to do all the hard work for us! 😂
- The script is [also available in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/danilofreire/datasci385/blob/main/lectures/lecture-10/iv_estimation.R)
- Let's do it together, step-by-step, to make sure we all understand what the coefficients mean 🤓
:::

## IV estimation in R
### ITT

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- First, let's load the data and estimate the [ITT]{.alert}
- Remember that $ITT_Y = 0.057$ when we calculated it manually?
- We will use the `lm_robust` function to estimate the [ITT]{.alert}
- Can you explain what the coefficients mean?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
library(estimatr)

# Load the data
df <- read.csv("./mullainathan.csv")

# Rename variables
ASSIGNED <- df$watch
TREATED <- df$watchdps
Y <- df$ochange

# Estimate ITT
itt_model <- lm_robust(Y ~ ASSIGNED)
summary(itt_model)

# Extract ITT for later
ITT <- coef(itt_model)[2]
```
:::

## ITT interpretation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Let's see coefficients table mean:
- `(Intercept)`: 
  - Estimate: 0.41818
  - The intercept is the predicted value of `Y` (opinion change) when `ASSIGNED = 0` (control group)
  - This is approximately the [average rate of opinion change in the control group]{.alert}
  - Looking back at our table, the "% Reporting change (total N)" in the control group was 41.8% or 0.418. Pretty good!
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- `ASSIGNED`: 
  - Estimate: 0.05707
  - This is the coefficient for `ASSIGNED`
  - It's the [estimated difference in the average value of Y (opinion change) between those assigned to the treatment condition and those who were not]{.alert}
  - This is our [regression estimate of the ITT]{.alert}! 
  - And it's very close to the 0.057 we calculated by hand before
- The results show that the p-value is close to 0.05, suggesting marginal statistical significance
:::
:::
:::

## IV estimation in R
### ITT_D

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- So the first step is done! 🥳
- Now let's estimate the [ITT_D]{.alert}
- $ITT_D = 0.204$, correct?
- We will use the `lm_robust` function again, but this time with the `TREATED` variable

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Estimate ITT_D
itt_d_model <- lm_robust(TREATED ~ ASSIGNED)
summary(itt_d_model)

# Extract ITT_D for later
ITT_D <- coef(itt_d_model)[2]
```
:::

## ITT_D interpretation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Let's see coefficients table mean this time:
- `(Intercept)`: 
  - Estimate: 0.1625
  - The intercept is the predicted value of `TREATED` when `ASSIGNED = 0` (control group)
  - This is approximately the [average rate of watching the debate in the control group]{.alert}
  - Looking back at the counts, $80/495 \approx 0.162$ indeed
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- `ASSIGNED`: 
  - Estimate: 0.2041
  - This is the coefficient for `ASSIGNED = 1`
  - It's the [estimated difference in the average value of TREATED between those assigned to the treatment condition and those who were not]{.alert}
  - This is our [regression estimate of the ITT_D]{.alert}! 
  - So those who were assigned to the treatment group were [about 20 percentage points more likely to watch the debate]{.alert} than those who were not
  - The p-values are quite low this time, so the results are statistically significant
:::
:::
:::

## Putting it all together
### IV estimation of CACE

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 24px;"}
- Now that we have both [ITT]{.alert} and [ITT_D]{.alert}, we can calculate the [CACE]{.alert}

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
# Calculate CACE
cace <- iv_robust(Y ~ TREATED | ASSIGNED)
summary(cace)

# Check value
ITT/ITT_D 
```
:::

## CACE interpretation

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Our final table indicates that:
- `(Intercept)`: 
  - Estimate: 0.41818
  - This is the predicted value of `Y` when `TREATED = 0` (control group)
  - This is approximately the [average rate of opinion change in the control group]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- `TREATED`: 
  - Estimate: 0.2787
  - It's the [estimated difference in the average value of Y (opinion change) between those who were treated and those who were not]{.alert}
  - This is our [regression estimate of the CACE]{.alert}, our main estimate in this experiment
- The p-value is above 0.05, so there is no statistical significance here
:::
:::

# Now you're experts in non-compliance 😎 {background-color="#2d4563"}

## Discussing the assumptions in this model
### And how to deal with them in practice (in your own experiments!)

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- Let's start with the [monotonicity assumption]{.alert}
- In this case, [defiers would be people who watch the debate if encouraged not to]{.alert}, while [not watching the debate if told to do so]{.alert}
- This behaviour [does seem a little weird]{.alert}, but it's not impossible
- Suppose some people get bored and just flip from one channel to another and end up watching the debate
- Remember that, when we have defiers, [we cannot estimate the CACE]{.alert} because $ITT_D$ is not identified (it includes both compliers and defiers)
- How big a problem is this in practice? [It depends on the context]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- If the ratio of defiers is small, the [bias introduced by defiers is small too]{.alert} and CACE is still a good estimate
- So what to do?
  - [Create treatments that more closely align with the preferences of the subjects]{.alert}
  - Check if any [reverse psychology]{.alert} or [reason to resist the treatment]{.alert} exists
  - Finally, check if the [control condition seems unfair]{.alert} or [unattractive]{.alert}, so that people would resist them
:::
:::
:::

## Exclusion restriction

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 21px;"}
:::{.columns}
:::{.column width=50%}
- The [exclusion restriction]{.alert} is another key assumption in this model
- It states that the [instrumental variable (Z) affects the outcome (Y) only through the treatment (D)]{.alert}
- In our example, the [assignment to watch the debate (Z) should only affect opinion change (Y) through watching the debate (D)]{.alert}
- Oh well... [This is a tough one]{.alert}
- Imagine that people who watch the debate [start reading more newspapers]{.alert} and [become more informed]{.alert}, which leads to opinion change
- In this case, the [exclusion restriction is violated]{.alert}, and the [IV estimate is biased]{.alert}
:::

:::{.column width=50%}
- Another possible violation is when [people are aware of observer's presence]{.alert} and [change their behaviour]{.alert}
- This is a serious problem in [survey experiments about sensitive topics]{.alert}, like [voting intentions]{.alert} or [drug use]{.alert}
- In these cases, people may [lie about their behaviour]{.alert} to avoid embarrassment or legal consequences
- So the effect will be overestimated because people are [more likely to report what they think the observer wants to hear]{.alert}
- How to deal with this? [Difficult to say!]{.alert}
- In my experience, the best solution is to use [objective measures]{.alert} whenever possible, that is, indicators that [do not depend on self-reporting]{.alert}
- Do you want to talk more about this? [Let's discuss!]{.alert} 😉

- How do you think we could [lower the number of defiers]{.alert} in this study?
- What about the [exclusion restriction]{.alert}? How could we [make sure that the IV only affects the outcome through the treatment]{.alert}?
- Do you think that [people's behaviour would change if they knew they were being observed]{.alert}? How could we [mitigate this problem]{.alert}?
- Finally, do you think that the [results are generalisable]{.alert}? Why or why not?
- Think about your own experiments: [How would you deal with these issues]{.alert}?

## Next class

:::{style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: 28px;"}
- Next class, we will discuss [attrition]{.alert} (missing data in the outcome)
- We will see how to deal with [missing data]{.alert} in experiments and how to [impute missing values]{.alert} (should you do it?)
- Please also send me your ideas for the [group project]{.alert}! I'm looking forward to hearing from you! 🤓
- Thanks to all of you who have already done so! You're awesome! 🥳

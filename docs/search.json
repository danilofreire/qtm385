    "text": "Experimental methods have become increasingly important in social and life sciences, offering reliable ways to test theories and produce generalisable findings. This course covers the essential principles of experimental design, with emphasis on testing causal relationships. Students will learn about causal inference, experimental design techniques, and methods for addressing common challenges in experimental research, such as non-compliance and participant attrition. The course also explores blocking and covariate adjustment, heterogeneous treatment effects, and proper interpretation of results. Special attention will be given to reproducible research practices and ethical considerations in experimental studies.\nThis course is designed to be both applied and interactive, featuring lectures and hands-on sessions. Students will learn how to design and implement experiments and critically evaluate existing experimental research in their areas of interest. Moreover, students will have the opportunity to develop their writing and presentation skills by drafting an experimental research project and presenting their findings.\n\nCourse Information\nWe will meet on Mondays and Wednesdays from 5:30pm to 6:45pm in the Psychology Building 220. The course will be a mix of lectures, discussions, and hands-on activities. Therefore, it is important that you read the assigned readings before class. Students are encouraged to participate and are most welcome to express their views openly and freely. I would suggest you to bring some notes to the class so that we can discuss together the topics you find most interesting.\nAll information about the course will be available at http://danilofreire.github.io/datasci385. The syllabus will be updated periodically according to the progress of the class. Please remember to visit the website regularly.\n\n\nLearning Objectives\nBy the end of this course, students will be able to:\n\nDesign rigorous experiments with proper randomisation procedures and sample sizing calculations\nCreate pre-analysis plans (PAP) and apply appropriate statistical methods for experimental analysis\nProduce reproducible reports using Quarto\nEvaluate experimental designs, identifying potential limitations\nManage unexpected data challenges, such as attrition and non-compliance\nUnderstand ethical considerations in experimental design\nDevelop analytical skills through practical problem sets and discussion sessions\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis course is designed for students who have taken or are currently taking an introductory course in statistics. Some understanding of hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis is beneficial. However, if you have not taken such courses, that is also fine. The course is not math-heavy, and all concepts will be explained in detail in class. Some familiarity with R or Python is required, as we will use these tools for data analysis. We can adjust the course accordingly if you need assistance. If you are unsure whether you meet the prerequisites, please contact me to discuss your background.\n\n\nSoftware\nWe will use R for all data analysis in this course. R is a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. You can download R from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). You are free to use any text editor to write your R code, but I recommend using RStudio, VSCode, or Jupyter Notebooks with the R kernel. If you are feeling brave or want to learn some new skills, you can also use Neovim with the Nvim-R plugin. That is, if you can exit the editor. :)\nWe will also use Quarto to write the reports. Quarto is a new document format that combines the best features of Markdown, , and R Markdown. It is easy to use, very versatile, and allows you to write reports, slides, books, and even websites in a single document. You can install Quarto from the Quarto website. We will have a hands-on session on how to use Quarto in the course, and I have prepared templates for your pre-analysis plan and presentation. However, you are free to use any other template you prefer or even write your own.\n\n\nOffice Hours\nI am very flexible with office hours, but it is easier to contact me via email. Feel free to send me a message any time at danilo.freire@emory.edu, and I will likely reply within a few hours. My office address is in the Psychology and Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, 36 Eagle Row, 4th Floor, room 480. Please email me a couple of days in advance to ensure that no two students book the same time slot.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nUpon every individual who is a part of Emory University falls the responsibility for maintaining in the life of Emory a standard of unimpeachable honour in all academic work. The Honour Code of Emory College is based on the fundamental assumption that every loyal person of the University not only will conduct his or her own life according to the dictates of the highest honor, but will also refuse to tolerate in others action which would sully the good name of the institution. Academic misconduct is an offense generally defined as any action or inaction which is offensive to the integrity and honesty of the members of the academic community. The typical sanction for a violation of the Emory Honor Code is an F in the course. Any suspected case of academic misconduct will be referred to the Emory Honour Council.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence\nStudents have to submit a series of problem sets and complete two group projects. You are encouraged to use AI to assist with your assignments, as learning to use AI is a valuable and emerging skill. I am available to provide support and assistance with these tools during office hours or by appointment. However, please note that any errors or omissions resulting from the use of AI tools are your responsibility. Do not rely solely on AI to complete your assignments; you must always double-check your work. Remember to cite all sources used in your problem sets and projects, including AI tools. Please include a note at the end of any document indicating that AI was used in its development.\n\n\nSpecial Needs and Accessibility Services\nI am fully committed to providing the necessary accommodations to ensure that all students have an equal opportunity to succeed in this course. Students with medical/health conditions that might impact academic success should visit the Department of Accessibility Services (DAS) to determine eligibility for appropriate accommodations. Students who receive accommodations should contact me with an Accommodation Letter from the DAS at the beginning of the semester, or as soon as the accommodation is granted. If you wish to do so, feel free to request an individual meeting to further discuss the specific accommodations.\n\n\nEnglish Language Learners\nEmory University welcomes students from around the country and the world, and the unique perspectives international and multilingual students bring enrich the campus community. To empower multilingual learners, an array of support is available including language and culture workshops and individual appointments. For more information about English Language Learning support at Emory, please contact the ELLP Specialists at https://writingcenter.emory.edu. No student will be penalised for their command of the English language.\n\n\nAssignments and Grading Policy\nProblem Sets: 50%. There will be ten problem sets throughout the course, each focusing on different aspects of experimental design and analysis. These assignments are designed to reinforce concepts covered in lectures and readings, and to provide hands-on practice with experimental design techniques. Problem sets will include a mix of theoretical questions and practical applications. They will be assigned regularly and must be completed individually. You may discuss your work with other colleagues as long as you do not copy entire sentences, just changing a few words. If you worked with other students, please write down their names on your problem set. Please also acknowledge any sources you used in your work, including textbooks, articles, and AI resources.\nPre-Analysis Plan (PAP): 20%. Students will work in groups to develop a pre-analysis plan for an experimental study. The PAP should be written in Quarto and include the following components:\n\nResearch question and hypotheses\nExperimental design and randomisation procedure\nSample size and power calculations\nPrimary and secondary outcome measures\nDetailed analysis plan, including statistical models and robustness checks\nPlan for handling issues such as missing data, non-compliance issues, and attrition\n\nA guide for writing the PAP will be available in the course GitHub repository and webpage. This assignment will help students develop skills in planning and pre-registering experiments, a crucial practice in modern experimental research.\nFinal Project: 30%. The final project will consist of a short presentation, created using Quarto, based on the pre-analysis plans developed earlier in the course. For this assignment, I will simulate data based on each group’s PAP, intentionally introducing challenges such as missing data on covariates and non-compliance. Students will need to analyse this simulated data as if it were the true results of their proposed experiments, addressing any issues that arise in light of their original PAP. The presentation should include:\n\nA brief overview of the experimental design.\nResults of the primary and secondary analyses.\nDiscussion of how deviations from the PAP were handled.\nInterpretation of results and their implications.\nReflections on the challenges encountered and lessons learned.\n\nThis project will assess students’ ability to apply their knowledge of experimental design in a realistic scenario, adapting to unexpected challenges that often arise in real-world research.\nPlease submit all assignments in PDF format via Canvas before class (include your code). Work submitted late will be penalised by one letter grade every 24 hours unless discussed with the instructor.\n\n\nGrading Scale\nEach student’s final grade will be based on the following after rounding up to the nearest point:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrade\nA\nA-\nB+\nB\nB-\nC\nD\nF\n\n\n\n\nRange\n91%–100%\n86%–90%\n81%–85%\n76%–80%\n71%–75%\n66%–70%\n60%–65%\n&lt;60%\n\n\n\n\n\nMaterials\nThe main textbook for this course is:\n\nGerber, Alan S., and Donald P. Green. 2012. Field Experiments: Design, Analysis, and Interpretation. New York: W.W. Norton. (Referred to as FEDAI in the syllabus)\n\nStudents should closely read the assigned chapters and papers prior to the course date for which they are assigned. FEDAI will serve as our primary reference throughout the course.\nThis book is available:\n\nOn course reserves at Robert W. Woodruff Library\nFor purchase at the campus bookstore\nOnline through retailers like Amazon\n\nAdditional readings will be provided through the course website or the library’s electronic resources.\nStudents are encouraged to make use of the library’s resources, including its research guides and citation tools, to support their work in this course.\n\n\nSubject to Change Policy\nWhile I will try to adhere to the course schedule as much as possible, I also want to adapt to your learning pace and style. The syllabus and course plan may change in the semester. Again, please visit the course website regularly to check for updates. I will also announce any changes in class and via email.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

These plans have become increasingly important in social and biological sciences as a tool to enhance research transparency, credibility, and reproducibility. PAPs serve as a roadmap for researchers, helping them think through their study design and analysis strategy in advance, while also providing a public record of their intentions.\nThe use of PAPs has grown significantly in recent years, particularly in fields such as economics, political science, and psychology. According to the American Economic Association’s website, as of 2024, the AEA RCT Registry currently lists about 10,000 studies with locations in 169 countries. This trend reflects a growing recognition of the importance of research transparency and the need to address issues such as publication bias and p-hacking."

    "text": "Enhancing Research Transparency\nPAPs provide a clear record of the researcher’s intentions before data collection or analysis, reducing concerns about data mining or selective reporting. By specifying analyses in advance, researchers demonstrate their commitment to transparent and unbiased research practices. This transparency allows other researchers and stakeholders to distinguish between pre-planned analyses and exploratory findings, increasing confidence in the reported results.\nFor example, in a study on the effects of a cash transfer program on educational outcomes, researchers might specify in their PAP that they will analyse the impact on primary school enrollment rates, test scores, and dropout rates. By doing so, they commit to reporting these outcomes regardless of whether the results are statistically significant or align with their hypotheses. This approach prevents the temptation to selectively report only positive or interesting findings after seeing the data."

    "text": "Improving Research Quality\nBy forcing researchers to think through their analysis in advance, PAPs can lead to better-designed studies and more robust analytical approaches. This process often reveals potential issues or oversights that can be addressed before data collection begins. For instance, when drafting a PAP, researchers might realise they need to include additional control variables or consider potential confounding factors they had not initially thought of.\nConsider a medical study examining the effectiveness of a new drug. In developing the PAP, researchers might recognise the need to stratify their sample based on age groups or pre-existing conditions, leading to a more nuanced and informative analysis. They might also identify potential interaction effects between the drug and other medications, prompting them to collect data on participants’ full medical histories."

    "section": "Addressing Publication Bias",
    "text": "Addressing Publication Bias\nPAPs can help combat publication bias by encouraging the reporting of all pre-specified analyses, regardless of their results. This approach ensures that null or unexpected findings are not selectively omitted from publication. Publication bias is a significant issue in many fields, where studies with positive or novel results are more likely to be published than those with null or negative findings.\nFor example, in psychology, the “file drawer problem” refers to the tendency for studies with non-significant results to remain unpublished. By pre-registering their analyses, researchers commit to reporting all findings, which can help provide a more balanced view of the evidence. In a meta-analysis of psychological interventions, for instance, including pre-registered studies might reveal that the overall effect size is smaller than what would be estimated based solely on published literature."

    "text": "Increasing Credibility\nPre-registering analyses can increase the credibility of research findings, as it demonstrates that the results were not cherry-picked or manipulated to achieve desired outcomes. This is particularly important in fields where research findings can influence policy decisions or clinical practices.\nFor instance, in a study on the effectiveness of a new educational intervention, pre-registering the primary outcome measures (e.g., standardised test scores) and analysis methods prevents researchers from selectively reporting only the most favorable results. If the intervention shows mixed effects – perhaps improving math scores but not reading scores – the PAP ensures that both outcomes are reported, providing a more accurate picture of the intervention’s impact."

    "text": "Facilitating Replication\nDetailed PAPs make it easier for other researchers to replicate studies, as they provide a clear roadmap of the intended analyses and methodologies. Replication is crucial for scientific progress, but it often fails due to insufficient information about the original study’s methods.\nFor example, in a complex econometric analysis of labor market policies, a well-written PAP would specify not only the data sources and variables used but also the exact statistical models, including any transformations or coding of variables. This level of detail allows other researchers to reproduce the analysis, even if they do not have access to the original data, by following the same procedures with similar datasets."

    "text": "Welcome to the Quarto guide for DATASCI 385! This guide provides an introduction to Quarto, a document authoring system that supports Markdown, LaTeX, R, Python, and more. Quarto is designed to help you create reproducible research documents and presentations, making it a great tool for academic writing and data analysis.\nQuarto is very versatile and easy to use. If you are familiar with Jupyter Notebooks, you will be right at home with Quarto. R Markdown users will find Quarto even easier, as it is only a more powerful version of R Markdown, which supports multiple programming languages (such as Python) and output formats.\nIn this guide, you will learn how to install Quarto, create a new Quarto project, write content in Markdown, and generate output formats such as HTML, PDF, and slides. You will also explore advanced features of Quarto, such as code execution, citations, and cross-references. By the end of this guide, you will be able to use Quarto effectively for your research projects and presentations.\n\nWhy is reproducing research important?\nReproducibility is the ability of an entire experiment or study to be duplicated, either by the same researcher or by someone else working independently. Reproducing research is important for several reasons:\n\nTransparency: Reproducible research allows others to verify the results of a study and build upon them. It promotes transparency and trust in the scientific process.\nError detection: Reproducing research can help identify errors or inconsistencies in the original study. It allows researchers to correct mistakes and improve the quality of their work.\nKnowledge dissemination: Reproducible research makes it easier to share knowledge and findings with the broader scientific community. It enables others to learn from and build on existing research.\nResearch integrity: Reproducible research is essential for maintaining the integrity of the scientific process. It helps prevent fraud, bias, and other unethical practices.\n\nCurrently, there is a reproducibility crisis in many scientific fields, including psychology, medicine, and economics. Many studies are not reproducible due to factors such as poor experimental design, publication bias, and the use of p-values. By adopting reproducible practices and tools like Quarto, researchers can help address this crisis and improve the reliability of scientific research.\n\n\nInstalling Quarto\nTo get started with Quarto, you need to install the Quarto CLI (Command Line Interface) on your computer. Quarto is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Follow the instructions below to install Quarto on your operating system:\n\nGo to the https://quarto.org/docs/download/ and select the appropriate download link for your operating system.\nRun the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.\nIf you use macOS, you can also install Quarto using Homebrew. Run the following commands in your terminal to install Homebrew and Quarto:\n\n# Install Homebrew\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"\n\n# Install Quarto\nbrew install quarto\nIf you use VS Code (which I recommend), you can also install the Quarto extension to work with Quarto projects directly in the editor. It makes things easier and more convenient.\nFor more detailed installation instructions, refer to the Quarto documentation.\n\n\nCreating a new Quarto document\nQuarto uses the .qmd file extension for Quarto Markdown files. These files can be converted into various output formats, such as HTML, PDF, Word documents, slides, and even websites. This website, the syllabus, and all class slides were created using Quarto!\nHere you will not need to use Quarto for anything other than your pre-analysis plans (and slides if you are feeling adventurous). So you can simply use the PAP Template to create your PAPs. But you will need to install a few things to make sure you can compile your PAPs into PDFs.\nFirst, you need to install Pandoc, a universal document converter that Quarto uses to generate output formats. Pandoc is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. You can download the installer from the Pandoc website or install it using Homebrew on macOS:\nbrew install pandoc\nNext, you need to install a LaTeX distribution to generate PDF output. I recommend using TinyTeX, a lightweight LaTeX distribution that works well with Pandoc. The easiest way to install TinyTeX is through Quarto itself:\nquarto install tinytex\nFor a more complete LaTeX distribution, you can install TeX Live, which includes additional packages and tools. Please refer to the TeX Live website for installation instructions.\nWith these tools, you should be good to go!\n\n\nWriting content in Quarto\nQuarto supports Markdown, a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. Markdown is easy to read and write, making it a great choice for creating content quickly and efficiently. In Quarto, you can use Markdown to format text, add images, create lists, and more. The Markdown Guide provides a detailed overview of Markdown syntax and features.\nBut before you start writing the document, you need to include a header with metadata about the document. This metadata includes the title, author, date, and other information that Quarto uses to generate the output. It should be placed at the beginning of the document between two sets of three dashes (---). Here is an example of a document header in Quarto:\n---\ntitle: \"My Quarto Document\"\nauthor: \"John Doe\"\ndate: \"2022-01-01\"\nformat:\n  pdf:\n    toc: false\n    toc-depth: 2\n    number-sections: true\n    colorlinks: true\n    mainfont: \"Times New Roman\"\n    geometry: \n      - top=2cm \n      - bottom=2cm \n      - left=2cm \n      - right=2cm\n    cite-method: natbib\n    biblio-style: apalike\n    bibliography: references.bib\neditor:\n  render-on-save: false\n---\nThe header above uses knitr as the default code engine (R). You can also use Jupyter as your code engine, just add jupyter: python3 to the header.\nIf you would like to use a more complex header, you can refer to my PDF template: https://github.com/danilofreire/quarto-templates/tree/main/article.\nAfter the header, you can start writing the content of your document using Markdown syntax.\n\n\nGenerating output formats\nOnce you have written your Quarto document, you can generate output formats using the Quarto CLI or the VS Code extension. To generate an output format, run the following command in your terminal:\nquarto render my-document.qmd --to pdf\nThis command tells Quarto to render the my-document.qmd file into a PDF format. You can replace pdf with other output formats such as html, docx, slides, etc. Quarto will generate the output file in the same directory as the input file.\nYou can also simply use the VS Code extension to render the document. Just open the .qmd file in VS Code and click on the “Preview” button in the top right corner.\n\nIt will open a preview of the document in your editor, like this:\n\nBoth pictures are from the Quarto documentation. Please have a look at this page for more information on how to use Quarto with VS Code.\n\n\nCreating a .bib file\nIf you are using citations in your document, you will need to create a .bib file with your references. A .bib file is a BibTeX database that contains bibliographic information about your sources. You can create a .bib file using a text editor or reference management software like Zotero, Mendeley, or JabRef.\nOne of the easiest (and my favourite) ways to create a .bib file is to use Google Scholar. Just search for the paper you want to cite, click on the quotation marks below the title, and select BibTeX. It will give you the BibTeX entry for that paper, which you can copy and paste into your .bib file.\nFor instance, to cite Paul Holland’s paper “Statistics and Causal Inference”, click on the quotation marks below the title, and you will see the BibTeX entry:\n@article{holland1986statistics,\n  title={Statistics and causal inference},\n  author={Holland, Paul W},\n  journal={Journal of the American statistical Association},\n  volume={81},\n  number={396},\n  pages={945--960},\n  year={1986},\n  publisher={Taylor \\& Francis}\n}\nThen you just need to copy and paste this entry into your .bib file. When you cite this paper in your Quarto document (e.g., This is a paper by @holland1986statistics), Quarto will automatically generate the bibliography for you.\n\n\nAdditional resources\nQuarto has a lot of features and capabilities that are not covered in this guide. It also has hundreds of templates that you can use, as well as a great community that is always willing to help. Here are some resources that you may find useful:\n\nQuarto official website.\nAwesome Quarto: https://github.com/mcanouil/awesome-quarto. This repository contains dozens of tutorials, examples, and resources.\nÇetinkaya-Rundel, M. & Lowndes, J. S. (2022) Keynote talk: Hello Quarto: Share • Collaborate • Teach • Reimagine. Slides and source code. This is one of the nicest Quarto presentations I have seen.\nGetting Started with Quarto (YouTube). Posit (formerly RStudio) has a series of tutorials on Quarto on their YouTube channel. You can find their playlist here.\nQuarto extensions. Several extensions are available to enhance the functionality of Quarto, such as manuscript templates, citations, and cross-references.\n\nI think that is all you need to know for now! If you have any questions, or would like me to expand this guide, please let me know. All the best!\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

[2-3 pieces]\n\n\n\n\nSecondary hypotheses\n\n\nWhat are the secondary paramater/estimands the research design seeks to estimate? What sign and/or magnitude is predicted by the secondary hypotheses for each parameter/estimand [These may be conditional effects for subgroups or hypotheses about additional outcomes or cross- randomized treatments.]\nWhat is the logic or theory of change behind each secondary hypothesis? [Explain what effects we should expect if the theory behind your primary hypothesis is correct.]\n\n\n\n\nAlternative explanations if results are consistent with hypotheses\n\n\nWhat alternative theories could explain the results?\nHypothesis for an alternative outcome (or other subgroups) that would be consistent only with the alternative explanation and not the logic behind your primary hypothesis.\n\n\n\n\nAlternative explanations if results are inconsistent with hypotheses\n\n\nWhat alternative theories could explain the results?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Population and Sample\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopulation of interest\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere and when will your study take place?\n\n\nDoes this match up to your population of interest, or are there conditions that make this study context different?\n\n\n\n\nSample size\n\n\nHow is this sample selected? Be specific about the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nConsent\n\n\nHow will you obtain informed consent? If you will not, what is the justification?\nIs this population vulnerable to being coerced into participating in the study?\n\n\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nIs the sample size large enough that you have sufficient power for your research conclusions to be credible and useful?\nIs the sample size no larger than necessary for the research?\nCan the research (results) be used to target people or make people more vulnerable?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Intervention\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus Quo\n\n\nDescribe the status quo–what are the current conditions in terms of the outcomes you hope to change? What aspects of the intervention already exist, if any?\n\n\n\n\nIntervention\n\n\nDescribe your intervention(s)\nWhat is already known about the effect of the proposed intervention relative to the status quo? Is there credible evidence on the question?\n\n\n\n\nControl\n\n\nDescribe the control condition\nIs the control condition a pure control (no intervention at all) or a placebo? What is the placebo contition designed to control for?\n\n\n\n\nUnits\n\n\nTo what units (level) will the intervention be applied? Individual, classroom, school, village, municipality, etc.\nIs this the same level at which outcomes will be measured? If not, how will you address the different levels if they do not perfectly overlap?\n\n\n\n\nCompliance\n\n\nWhat does it mean to “take” (comply with) the the intervention?\nIf the intervention is a prgram, how much someone need to attend (showing up once? finishing the program?) in order to count as having attended?\n\n\n\n\nNon- Compliance\n\n\nIs there any concern with non-compliance (either taking the intervention if assigned to control/placebo or failing to take the intervention if assigned to treatment)?\n\n\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nIs the control condition no worse than the status quo, according to the best evidence available?\nAre there concerns that participants may be forced to comply wiht the intervention?\nWhat are the risks and magnitude of potentially negative effects of the treatment? Are such risks concentrated on a particular subset of your population?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4: Outcome and Covariates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary Outcome\n\n\nWhat is your primary outcome?\n\n\n\n\nMeasurement\n\n\nHow will it be measured? (Give the actual text of the survey question and response options, if using a survey measure. Is the outcome continuous, binary, etc.?)\n\n\n\n\nPriors\n\n\nWhat is the expected distribution of the primary outcome? (This may come from a prior study on a similar population or you may have to make an educated guess).\n\n\n\n\nValidity and measurement error\n\n\nIs there any concern with untruthful reporting? If so, how will you address it?\n\n\n\n\nStages\n\n\nWill you collect a baseline?\nWill you collect a midline?\nWill you collect multiple waves of endline measurement?\nIf you will collect a baseline or midline, how will you find the same respondents (minimize attrition?)\n\n\n\n\nCovariates\n\n\nWhat covariate data do you need, including for subgroup analysis? How will covariates be measured?\nWhat addtional covariates (if any) will you measure?\nWhat additional outcomes or covariates will you collect to distinguish between your explanation and alternatives if your findings are consistent with your hypothesis?\n\n\n\n\nEthics\n\n\nWill data collection be onerous (time, effort) or painful (physically, emotionally) for any respondents?\nAre these costs necessary? Have they been minimized?\nAre they outweighed by the potential benefits of the research to society?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 5: Randomization\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRandomization strategy\n\n\nComplete/simple, block, cluster, factorial etc.\n\n\n\n\nBlocks\n\n\nWhat are they, how many blocks, how many units per block?\n\n\n\n\nClusters\n\n\nWhat are they, how many clusters, how many units per cluster?\nIf you have clusters, what is the intra-class correlation (ICC)?\nIs clustering strictly necessary, or could you randomize at the individual level?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 6: Analysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstimator\n\n\nWhat is your estimator?\n\n\n\n\nStandard Errors\n\n\nWhat kind of standard errors will you use?\n\n\n\n\nTest\n\n\nIf you plan to report a p-value, what kind of test will you use?\n\n\n\n\nMissing Data\n\n\nHow will you handle missing data?\n\n\n\n\nEffect size\n\n\nWhat is the expected effect size?

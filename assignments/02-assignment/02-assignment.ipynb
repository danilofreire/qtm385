        "1.  What is the fundamental problem of causal inference, and how does\n",
        "    the potential outcomes framework help us understand it?\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  Explain the following notation:\n",

        "    -   $Y_i(1)$\n",
        "    -   $Y_i(0)$\n",

        "    -   $Y_i(1) | T = 0$\n",
        "    -   Is $E[Y_i(1)]$ the same as $E[Y_i(1) | T = 1]$? Why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Explain the concept of selection bias. How does it affect our\n",
        "    ability to estimate causal effects?\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), and why\n",
        "    is it important for causal inference? Give an example of a situation\n",
        "    where SUTVA might be violated (not included in the slides).\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is a “balance test” (or “randomisation check”)? What is its\n",
        "    purpose and its limitations?\n",
        "\n",
        "6.  What is post-treatment bias (or overcontrol), and why is it a\n",

        "\n",
        "7.  A study examines the impact of a new teaching method on student test\n",

        "    traditional one. However, students in the new method group are more\n",

        "    this, and how might it affect the results?\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  Consider a new educational program and its effect on student test\n",
        "    scores. Students are randomly assigned to either the program or a\n",
        "    control group. However, the program’s effect varies depending on\n",
        "    students’ prior knowledge. What is this phenomenon called, and how\n",
        "    might it affect the interpretation of the results?\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  Suppose a new drug’s effect on blood pressure is being investigated.\n",
        "    Participants are randomly assigned to either the drug or a placebo.\n",
        "    However, some participants in the drug group do not adhere to the\n",

        "    regression analysis, and why it is a good idea to include covariates\n",

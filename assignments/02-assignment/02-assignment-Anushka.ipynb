        "This assignment covers lectures 3 and 4 of the course. It consists of 10 questions, each worth one point, about the potential outcomes framework, selection bias, and the use of regression in experimental research. You can answer the questions in any format you prefer, but I recommend using either Jupyter Notebook or PDF, as they are easier to read on Canvas. Please write at least two paragraphs for each written question.\n",

        "# Questions \n",
        "\n",
        "1.  What is the fundamental problem of causal inference, and how does the potential outcomes framework help us understand it? \n",
        "\n",
        "## The fundamental problem of causal inference is that we can never see both outcomes for one group or individual, it is either one or the other. For example, I either went to Emory or I didn't - I have no way of knowing if my life would be different if I didn't go here, because I already am here. \n",
        "\n",
        "## The potential oucomes framework helps us determine the effect of the treatment by measuring it using a similar individual. With the example above, it would be finding another person who went to my school and has otherwise similar chracateristics (major, gpa, ethnicity etc) but didn't go to Emory. \n",
        "\n",
        "2. Explain the following notation:\n",
        "    - $Y_i(1)$\n",
        "    # the potential outcome for individual i if they receive the treatment\n",
        "    - $Y_i(0)$\n",
        "    # the potential outcome for individual i if they do not receive the treatment\n",
        "    - $Y_i(0) | T = 1$\n",
        "    # the potential outcome under control for individual i conditional on recieiving treatment \n",
        "    - $Y_i(1) | T = 0$\n",
        "    #  the potential outcome under treatment for individual i conditional on NOT recieiving treatment (we cant observe this)\n",
        "    - Is $E[Y_i(1)]$ the same as $E[Y_i(1) | T = 1]$? Why or why not?\n",
        "\n",
        "    ## no! one is average potential outcome under treatment for the entire population, the other is the average observed outcome for those who actually received the treatment.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  Explain the concept of selection bias. How does it affect our ability to estimate causal effects? \n",
        "\n",
        "## selection bias is when the groups are different even without a treatment applied. This can lead to incorrect conclusions about the causal effects and conclusions about outcomes that are actually caused by differences in group, not the treatment\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  What is the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA), and why is it important for causal inference? Give an example of a situation where SUTVA might be violated (not included in the slides).\n",
        "\n",
        "## SUTVA states that the potential outcomes don't vary with treatment (there is only one treatment) and that the treatment effect on on person doesn't affect another person's outcome. This is important to make sure that there is a viable case on treatmenet and effect. \n",
        "\n",
        "## Ex: you wanted to measure if the day of the week you take an exam affects your score (is Monday inherently a bad day?) and you split students into random groups and had each group do it on a different day. However, if people from the monday exam go and talk to the rest of the classmates about the exam contents, then those students would gain an unfair advantage due to that interference, and would probably create the false conclusion that later in the week is better for tests - but it's really just that they knew what to expect on the exam. \n",
        "\n",
        "5.  What is a \"balance test\" (or \"randomisation check\")? What is its purpose and its limitations?\n",
        "\n",
        "## A balance test compares means of covariates of groups, checks for selection bias by checking how similar the groups are BEFORE treatment, and makes sure that any potential outcomes are due to differences that didn't already exist. Balance tests can only show visible differences though, not to mention that random variation is still a thing - this cam lead to errors and false conclusions in trying to narrow down groups, especially if the sample size is already small.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is post-treatment bias (or overcontrol), and why is it a problem?\n",
        "\n",
        "## post treatment bias is the act of controlling for variables affected by the treatment. This is a problem because this can lead to us making false conclusions about the treatment effect. For example, if you wanted to test if having an emotional support animal helps improve depression, you would want to control for the symptoms of the diagnosis beforehand, not stress levels after getting a pet - controlling for post treastment effect would obscure the true treatment effect\n",
        "\n",
        "7. A study examines the impact of a new teaching method on student test scores. Students are randomly assigned to either the new method or a traditional one. However, students in the new method group are more likely to withdraw from the study. What type of selection bias is this, and how might it affect the results?\n",
        "\n",
        "## This is attrition bias, aka when a participant drops out of the study before it finishes. This can lead to a false conclusion on treatment effect. For example, if the people in the new group drop out, we don't know how the new method actually affects test scores, especially because it would be more likely that those who drop out are not doing well. The ones who don't drop out are probably doing better, so not factoring the dropouts can lead to the biased conclusion that the new method is improving test scores. \n",
        "\n",
        "8. Consider a new educational program and its effect on student test scores. Students are randomly assigned to either the program or a control group. However, the program's effect varies depending on students' prior knowledge. What is this phenomenon called, and how might it affect the interpretation of the results?\n",
        "\n",
        "## this is a heterogeneous treatment affect because the treatment works differently based on the individual. It makes it harder to make a generalization about the whole population if the ATE is different among subgroups\n",
        "\n",
        "9. Suppose a new drug's effect on blood pressure is being investigated. Participants are randomly assigned to either the drug or a placebo. However, some participants in the drug group do not adhere to the prescribed dosage. What is this issue called, and how might it affect the results?\n",
        "\n",
        "## this is non-compliance because they didn't follow the random assignment directions.  This reduces the viable effect to only those who complied and makes it harder to detect true causal impact - can be corrected with intent to treat and other such methods\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  Explain how to estimate the average treatment effect using regression analysis, and why it is a good idea to include covariates in the analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "## You can estimate ATE pretty easily with regressing outcome on treatment. Including ovariates can help improve precision and estimate treatment effect for sub groups of a population"

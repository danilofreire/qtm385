    "This assignment covers the first two classes of the course. It consists of 10 questions, each worth one point, about the fundamentals of randomised experiments and the use of theory in experimental research. You can answer the questions in any format you prefer, but I recommend using either Jupyter Notebook or PDF, as they are easier to read on Canvas. Please write at least two paragraphs for each written question.\n",

Because pre registered research is still publically avaliable, researchers may not have to worry as much about a lack of exposure regardless of their results. And in fact, by allowing others to look at null experiments, other researchers may be inspired to run similar experiments on their own that may have unexpected findings on the same topic. "

Emphasis is put more on a prime minister than a president, but Indian citizens don't have a say in the election of either - the president is elected by the house of parliament, and the prime minister is chosen by the president. While Indian citizens do have a say in some processes, like the Lok Sabha, those do not have as much power even within the parliament - so motivation to vote may not be as strong. \n",

These often don't affect us directly, but are justified in helping society as a whole. Meanwhile, while India's fundamental duties overlap, the impact of British cololial rule has left India still grappling with issues like poverty, overpopulation, and a developing economy. Causes like these often affect citizens and their family directly -  hence it is understandable that people may consider their civic duty to prioritize the wellbeings of theirselves and loved ones, over doing things that may not affect them.\n",

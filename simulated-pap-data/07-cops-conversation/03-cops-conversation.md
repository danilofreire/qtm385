Hello, everyone! Many thanks for sending me your PAP. There is a lot to like about your idea, and the topic is something I'm particularly interested in! Please find some comments below:

Strengths:

Addressing police distrust and testing community-based interventions is highly relevant and socially important.

The rationale linking police conduct, public trust erosion, and the need for interventions like dialogue circles is well-articulated.

The study aims to measure relevant constructs: trust, stress, safety perception, willingness to engage, and satisfaction.

You rightly anticipate significant non-compliance (both non-attendance by invitees and potential attendance by non-invitees) and the challenge of survey completion, which is crucial for this type of community intervention.

The list of potential confounders (demographics, criminal justice experience, family factors) covers key variables likely influencing attitudes towards police.

Areas for Improvement/Clarification:

The PAP mentions identifying "Districts in the metro Atlanta area" but then states "Individuals in districts... will be sent out the mail randomly" and later "individuals will be randomly assigned". This implies individual-level randomisation, which is good for causal inference comparing invitees vs. non-invitees (ITT).

However, the sampling prior to randomisation needs clarity. How are individuals selected from these districts to form the study sample before being randomised? Is it a full census mailing, or a random sample from resident lists?

Alternative Hypothesis (b) posits an *overall* increase in trust, even among non-attendees, due to spillover. While conceptually interesting, the current design (individual randomisation of invitations) doesn't directly measure or allow for causal estimation of community-wide spillover without further assumptions or design elements (e.g., randomising neighbourhoods to have forums or not, and surveying random samples within them). Estimating spillover from individual randomisation is complex and not well-addressed here. The primary focus should be on the effect of the *invitation* (ITT).

The description of the "structured Community-Police Dialogue Circles" is vague ("some speakers... open communication/discourse"). What is the content, format, duration, facilitator role, ratio of police-to-community members? Lack of standardisation across potential multiple forums could introduce significant variability.\

The use of arbitrary integer weights (e.g., "Over-policed" weight 5, "Trust in police" weight 2 for the primary index) is needs more justification. Standard practice would involve unweighted averages/sums of Likert items or factor analysis to derive index scores. The current weighting scheme could distort results and makes interpretation difficult.

The plan mentions testing the hypothesis by comparing post-Dialogue scores between groups (like t-tests) but then heavily features Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and includes complex Python code snippets (DR DiD, PSM) that seem a bit out of place for a standard randomised experiment analysis, especially given the mention of TTT1/TTT2 variables which don't map to the described Treatment/Control design. The Python code itself appears incomplete or incorrect in places (e.g., bootstrapping definition, calling the DR_DiD function).

The PAP mentions allowing non-invited attendees and controlling with an IV. This complicates the analysis considerably. A standard IV approach (Two-Stage Least Squares) would use the random invitation as an instrument for attendance to estimate the Treatment-on-the-Treated (TOT) effect, but this requires careful assumptions (exclusion restriction). Simply "adding in an IV" isn't a clear analytical strategy. It's better to focus on ITT first, then consider TOT via IV as a secondary analysis if desired and justified.

The PAP omits the discussion of the target sample size or a power analysis beyond listing factors to consider. This is an important flaw. Without knowing the intended N, it's impossible to judge feasibility or expected precision.

Defining compliance based on *both* attendance (for treatment) *and* survey completion seems overly strict. It conflates adherence to treatment delivery with adherence to measurement. Standard ITT analysis includes everyone as randomised, regardless of compliance or survey completion (handling missing outcomes separately).

Requiring all survey questions might deter participation or lead to inaccurate responses on sensitive items, conflicting with the goal of building trust. Allowing participants to skip questions is generally preferred.
